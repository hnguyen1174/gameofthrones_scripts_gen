EXT. BEYOND THE WALL - DAY
JON SNOW’s black-booted feet march across the tramped snow,
past DEAD WILDLINGS -- cut down with arrows, smashed with
rocks.
And the corpse of DONGO THE DOOMED, fallen giant. Ravens now
feed on his flesh.
Jon stops. He looks back over his left shoulder, where the
scythe-smashed bodies of the WILDLINGS who tried to climb the
Wall lie in a pile of broken and twisted limbs.
He looks forward to his right, where Mag’s flaming bull
mammoth stomped a swath through the wildling ranks in his
panicked final moments, leaving piles of CRUSHED WILDLINGS in
his wake. Faint wisps of smoke still rise from the animal’s
charred carcass.
Then Jon looks straight ahead, across the no-man’s-land
between the Wall and the woods. Somewhere in those woods lies
his destination: Mance’s camp.
Jon continues forward on the longest walk of his life.
EXT. TOP OF THE WALL - DAY
DOLOROUS EDD watches Jon, a speck of black against the snow,
as he disappears into the woods.
In the distance, Mance’s forest fire burns on, sending a
steady curtain of black smoke into the sky.
EXT. FOREST - OUTSKIRTS OF MANCE’S CAMP - DAY
Through the trees ahead Jon sees the outskirts of Mance’s
camp: a sprawling jumble of tents and cookfires and latrine
pits, children and goats wandering freely, sheep bleating
among the trees, horse hides pegged up to dry. No plan to it,
no order. Men and women and animals everywhere.
You don’t sneak up on wildlings in the woods: the WILDLING
MEN in front of Jon have been waiting for him, weapons in
hand. As have the WILDLING MEN who emerge from the trees
behind him.
Jon raises his hands above his head.
Saying nothing, the wildlings approach him and pat him down
for weapons, of which he has none. Then they shove him
forward toward the camp.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 1
EXT. MANCE’S CAMP - DAY
Jon marches forward, surrounded by his wildling guards. He’s
in the middle of the camp now, and everyone stops what
they’re doing to stare at him when he passes:
CHILDREN squatting by the fires. OLD WOMEN feeding dogs. CAVE
PEOPLE with painted faces. RAIDERS with claws and snakes and
severed heads painted on their shields. SPEARWIVES with long
hair that streams in the wind.
They’ve all lost friends and family to the Night’s Watch in
the previous day’s battle. They would all like to tear Jon to
pieces. But no one lays a hand on him. No one spits or throws
rocks or says a word.
As he proceeds, however, many look from Jon to his final
destination. Seeing them, Jon looks too -- to Mance’s polar
bear tent, set on a higher elevation than the others.
The entrance to the tent is fronted by a semi-circle of
WILDLING CHIEFTAINS, the leaders of each of the disparate
tribes that have been unified into a single army under
Mance’s leadership. The distinctness and specificity of their
costume and makeup is stunning.
Their weapons are all at the ready as Jon is brought before
them and halted with a rough hand to the shoulder.
MANCE RAYDER emerges from this tent. He’s not surprised by
Jon’s presence; word of his arrival has evidently preceded
him.
MANCE
You’re wearing a black cloak again.
JON
I’ve been sent to negotiate with
you.
Jon nods. He is definitely one of the two, or both.
Mance opens the tent and motions Jon inside. Jon enters. Six
of the chieftains follow him.
INT. MANCE'S TENT - CONTINUOUS
The day is bright but the tent is dim, lit only by a small
cookfire and a light glow from the translucent walls. A goat
slowly roasts over the fire.
The chieftains take up their places, evenly spaced around the
perimeter of the walls. Thinking about his self-appointed
mission -- killing Mance -- Jon clocks their fearsome
weapons. But the wildlings have them firmly in hand.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 2
(CONTINUED)
A simple wooden table sits in the middle of the tent, a threelegged stool on either side of it.
Mance enters last and steps past Jon. Jon’s eyes drop to
Mance’s sword, hanging from his side. Coming closer to Jon.
As Mance’s sword passes within inches of Jon’s sword hand,
Jon’s hand opens, weighing an immediate strike...
But he hesitates for a beat, and the opportunity passes as
Mance does. Mance steps to the table and sits on the stool
facing the tent entrance. He motions to the other stool.
Jon sits opposite Mance.
MANCE
It appears my trusting nature got
the better of me. It’s happened
before. I was hoping your loyalty
was real when you pledged yourself
to us, Jon Snow. Truly I was.
JON
The Halfhand ordered me to join
your army and bring back whatever
information I could to Castle
Black. He made me kill him so you’d
trust me.
(beat)
I was loyal: to him. And to my
Night’s Watch vows.
MANCE
All of them?
Mance has divined the obvious. Jon lowers his eyes.
MANCE
She wasn’t enough to turn you, eh?
(off his silence)
Were you enough to turn her?
JON
She put three arrows in me when I
escaped.
MANCE
Did you see her again at Castle
Black?
JON
Yes.
MANCE
And?

(CONTINUED)
JON
She’s dead.
MANCE
Your doing?
JON
No.
Killed by a young boy, but Jon doesn’t want to mention that.
MANCE
That’s for the best.
(beat)
Let’s drink to her.
He nods to a Chieftain. Jon notes the man sliding his hand
axe into his belt so he can pour two wooden cups of fermented
milk from a skin.
Jon’s hands flex beneath the table.
Unfortunately for Jon, when the chieftain comes to give them
the drink, he chooses the side of the table that puts the axe
next to Mance, not Jon.
Mance raises his cup. Jon looks warily at his own cup for a
moment. Mance smiles.
MANCE
Of all the ways I’d kill you,
poison would be the last.
He raises his cup.
MANCE
To Ygritte.
JON
To Ygritte.
They drink. Jon cannot hide the fact that fermented milk
tastes like day-old cock cheese. Mance laughs at his wincing
and coughing.
JON
That’s not wine.
MANCE
No, Jon Snow. That’s a proper
Northern drink.
(beat)
You did well. Fought hard, killed
some of our strongest men.
(beat)

(CONTINUED)
One of our giants went into your
tunnel and never came out again.
Mag the Mighty.
JON
He’s dead. He killed my friend
Grenn.
MANCE
Mag was their king, you know. The
last of a bloodline that stretches
back before the First Men.
JON
Grenn came from a farm.
Mance raises his cup.
MANCE
Mag and Grenn.
JON
Grenn and Mag.
Mance drains his cup and Jon does the same.
Mance turns to a different CHIEFTAIN:
MANCE
Kullback, could I trouble you for
something to eat? I don’t imagine
our guest has eaten anything for
quite some time.
The wildling chieftain goes over to the fire and fetches a
nasty looking carving knife. He begins carving slices from
the roasting goat’s haunch.
MANCE
So you’re here to strike a bargain.
JON
Turn your army around and go home.
Mance chuckles.
The chieftain finishes carving the goat and slams the carving
knife into a chopping block. He carries the sliced goat in
his bare hands to Mance and Jon.
The knife remains in the carving block, six feet from Jon.
Nothing stands between the carving knife and Jon.
Mance scrutinizes him.

MANCE (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
MANCE
You know that I know you’re low on
arrows, low on oil, low on men. How
many are left? Fifty?
JON
I told Tormund and Orell. We have
more than a thousand.
Mance shakes his head.
MANCE
I showed you everything I had, my
whole army, a hundred thousand
strong. And what did you do? You
fired on us -- with everything you
had. It wasn’t much.
Jon’s eyes flit to the carving knife when Mance looks away.
MANCE
As soon as I saw that, I sent four
hundred men to climb the Wall, an
unmanned stretch five miles west of
here. A lot of them will die
climbing, but most will make it
over by the end of the day.
(beat)
Here’s me being honest with you,
Jon Snow, which is more than you’ve
ever done for me. My people have
bled enough. I’m not here to
conquer. I’m here to hide behind
your Wall, just like you. We need
your tunnel. Now, we both know
that winter is coming. If my people
don’t get south of the Wall before
it comes in earnest, we’ll all end
up worse than dead.
Jon is here to do a dirty job. But Mance is telling the
truth, and Jon knows it. Which doesn’t make Jon’s job any
easier.
MANCE
You want to strike a bargain with
me? Here’s the bargain: you go back
and open the gates to us, and I
swear to you that no one else will
die. No more raids, no more
killing.
(beat)
Refuse and we’ll kill every last
man in Castle Black.
Jon’s eyes dart to the knife again. This time Mance sees it,
and it all becomes clear.

(CONTINUED)
MANCE
Ah. That’s why you’re here.
His chieftains pick up on his meaning and ready their weapons
-- but he stays their hands with a gesture.
Mance doesn’t go for his own sword. On the contrary, he puts
his hands on the table. He looks to the knife, then back to
Jon.
MANCE
I reckon you could do it before any
of them could stop you. They’d kill
you, of course, they’d kill you
slow. But you knew that when you
came in here.
Jon looks to the knife openly now, and to the men who will
torture him to death if he goes for it, whether or not he
succeeds in killing Mance.
MANCE
Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?
Killing a man in his own tent when
he’s just offered you peace? Is
that what the Night’s Watch is? Is
that what you are?
Yes. Here and now, that is what Jon is. His eyes, his
breathing, the tensing of his legs and arms and fingers are
all telling us so. He is getting ready to kill and to die.
And outside the tent, a horn blows.
The chieftains look to each other and to Mance.
Mance stands and draws on Jon, bringing his blade tip within
inches of Jon’s face.
MANCE
Are you attacking us?
JON
No. It’s just like you said. We
don’t have the men.
MANCE
If you’re lying to me, you’re a
dead man.
Mance storms from the tent, followed by his chieftains. Two
of them grab Jon Snow and drag him along.

EXT. MANCE'S CAMP - CONTINUOUS
Jon emerges to find utter chaos. People running every which
way. Wildlings fleeing into the fog, some of them throwing
down their weapons in panic.
MANCE
Hold! To me! To me!
It’s no use. The downside of freedom is how easily it falls
apart. Mance’s generals form up around him, however,
protecting their leader.
The source of the threat is ahead, to the east; whatever
people are running from is coming from that direction. We
hear it before we see it: trumpets, not war horns. The heavy
footfalls of armored horses and clangor of full plate.
And then they break through the fog: a great, well-formed
column of heavy cavalry, charging up the middle of the
wildling encampment like a spear of horseflesh and black
steel. They’re cutting down the wildlings, setting fire to
their tents, driving implacably forward.
And flying the burning heart banner of Stannis Baratheon.
Mance and Jon look to the left, where another cavalry column
is coming at them in the same fashion. The same on the right.
A pincer maneuver designed to do one thing: encircle Mance
Rayder.
Which they do presently, 100 HEAVILY ARMORED MEN surrounding
fourteen or so wildlings in skins and furs.
And down the middle of the center column, STANNIS BARATHEON
comes riding, with DAVOS SEAWORTH riding at his side and an
HONOR GUARD of Baratheon knights.
But the Free Folk don’t give up their freedom easily. A few
spit in the snow, hefting their weapons, ready to die
fighting.
Stannis was expecting as much. He draws his sword, signaling
the attack.
His mounted men attack.
Mance’s men defend their king. Members of a dozen different
tribes who have been killing each other for centuries, all
prepared to die for this man.
And die they do. With their armor, their horses and their
numbers, Stannis’ men are too much for Mance’s honor guard.
One by one, the leaders of the wildling tribes begin to fall.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 8
(CONTINUED)
One of the chieftains presses a dagger to Jon’s throat. If
this ends badly for them, it is going to end badly for Jon as
well. He prepares to cut Jon’s throat.
MANCE
Stand down.
They all look to him, making sure.
MANCE
Stand down. I said my people have
bled enough, and I meant it.
Mance throws his sword at Stannis’ feet. He looks to his men,
and they all throw down their weapons as well.
The wildling chieftain lets Jon go.
Stannis’ men look to their own king. He sheathes his sword,
dismounts, and approaches Mance. Davos dismounts behind him
and follows his king.
STANNIS
You’re the King Beyond the Wall.
Mance offers a nod but nothing more.
STANNIS
Do you know who I am?
MANCE
Never had the pleasure.
DAVOS
This is Stannis Baratheon, the one
true king of the Seven Kingdoms.
MANCE
We’re not in the Seven Kingdoms.
And you’re not dressed for this
weather.
STANNIS
It is customary to kneel when
surrendering to a king.
MANCE
We do not kneel.
STANNIS
I’ll have thousands of your men in
chains by nightfall. I’ve got
nowhere to put them. I’ve got
nothing to feed them.
(beat)

(CONTINUED)
I’m not here to slaughter beat
dogs. Their fate depends on their
king.
MANCE
All the same. We do not kneel.
Stannis stares at Mance for a beat before gesturing to his
subordinates.
STANNIS
Take these men away.
As Stannis’ men begin taking the prisoners, Davos notices Jon
Snow and points him out to Stannis.
DAVOS
Your Grace.
Stannis sees Jon and turns toward him.
DAVOS
What’s a man of the Night’s Watch
doing in a wildling camp?
JON
I was sent to discuss terms with
the King Beyond the Wall.
DAVOS
You’re speaking to the one true
King, boy. You will address him as
Your Grace.
JON
I know he’s the King. My father
died for him.
(to Stannis)
My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.
I’m Ned Stark’s son.
For the moment, Jon has become more interesting to Stannis
than the King Beyond the Wall.
STANNIS
Your father was an honorable man.
JON
He was, Your Grace.
STANNIS
(re: Mance)
What do you think your father would
have done with him?
Jon looks to Mance, whom he had been on the verge of killing
minutes ago.

STANNIS (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
Mance and the wildling chieftains all look to Jon; Stannis
doesn’t seem like the kind of man who asks a question if he’s
not interested in the answer.
JON
(looking at Mance)
I was this man’s prisoner once. He
could have tortured me. He could
have killed me. But he spared my
life.
(beat)
I think my father would have taken
him prisoner, and listened to what
he had to say.
Stannis weighs this advice.
STANNIS
Very well, then. Ser Davos -- take
him.
Davos leads Mance Rayder to Stannis’ honor guard. Stannis
turns to walk away.
JON
Your Grace.
Stannis turns back.
JON
If my father had seen the things
I’ve seen, he’d also tell you to
burn the dead before nightfall. All
of them.
INT. LABORATORY (PYCELLE'S ROOM) - DAY
An equally horrible sight: THE MOUNTAIN, lying on a massive
table. As we move along his leg, we see the gruesome rot
creeping around his knee, from the place where Oberyn’s
poisoned spear hamstrung him.
We hear his shallow, irregular breaths, the death rattle
sound -- and when we get to the wound in his midsection, it
is far worse, festering and blackening. The one beneath his
arm doesn’t look so hot, either.
And we keep moving onto QYBURN’s face, inches from the wound,
examining it, fixated upon it.
GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE and CERSEI LANNISTER both hold scented
handkerchiefs to their noses. Qyburn does not, even though he
is much closer to the body.
Cersei is not pleased. Her champion is dying.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 11
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
PYCELLE
I would suggest milk of the poppy
to ease his pain, but he is
completely insensate.
Timidly, Pycelle pokes the Mountain’s body with a long, thin
metal prod. Nothing.
CERSEI
Bloody Martells.
PYCELLE
The cause appears to be manticore
venom.
QYBURN
It is. The Death’s Head manticore.
Pycelle is mildly annoyed that the man would deign to speak,
even though Qyburn is agreeing with him.
PYCELLE
I’ve read a great deal about it. A
horrible poison, usually Mantari in
origin. Once it enters the
bloodstream...
Pycelle pokes the wound with his prod.
PYCELLE
Mm. Nothing to be done.
QYBURN
Yes there is.
This is Qyburn’s passion; we see as much on his face. He does
not ask for permission before leaping into action,
commandeering paraphernalia from Pycelle’s lab, setting it up
around the Mountain’s body: jars, oddly shaped herbs, vials
of colored liquids.
PYCELLE
May I ask what you think you’re
doing?
QYBURN
Saving him.
PYCELLE
Your Grace... I wish it were
otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond
saving. Well beyond. And this, this
man is not even a Maester, let
alone Grand Maester--
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 12
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
QYBURN
That’s for the best. No Maester
knows how to save him.
Qyburn lays out his personal collection of dubious medical
devices on a table and begins to pick out the ones he needs.
 PYCELLE
That is exactly the sort of
arrogance that got him expelled
from the Citadel, Your Grace.
But Cersei isn’t listening to him. She’s watching Qyburn
drawing fluids from the Mountain's body: inserting a thick
needle into his arm so his thickening, diseased blood can
trickle out of his body and into a draining pan on the floor.
PYCELLE
His curiosity was deemed dangerous
and unnatural, and rightly so, in
my opinion.
CERSEI
You’re dismissed, Grand Maester.
PYCELLE
But-- but, Your Grace, this is my
laboratory.
CERSEI
Not anymore.
Pycelle prepares to speak, but Cersei’s expression tells him
this would be a horrible idea.
Exit Pycelle.
Cersei addresses Qyburn.
CERSEI
You can save him?
QYBURN
Difficult to say, Your Grace.
(beat)
But if my past work is any guide,
we stand a chance.
As the Mountain’s bodily fluids continue to drain into the
pan on the floor, Qyburn prepares to replace them with a
large medieval syringe.
CERSEI
Do everything you can. Come to me
for anything you need.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 13
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
QYBURN
Thank you, Your Grace.
Qyburn fills the syringe from a jar of evil, viscous liquid.
QYBURN
You should know that the process
may... change him. Somewhat.
CERSEI
Will it weaken him?
QYBURN
(very much the contrary)
Oh no.
CERSEI
Very well, then.
Exit Cersei, as Qyburn slides the tip of the syringe into the
Mountain’s festering wound.
INT. CHAMBER OF THE HAND - DAY
Cersei sits before TYWIN LANNISTER at his desk.
TYWIN
Not another word. We’ve been over
this. The matter is closed.
CERSEI
I’m opening it again.
TYWIN
You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell,
you are still betrothed to Loras
Tyrell, and you will marry him as
soon as Tommen is married to
Margaery.
CERSEI
I will not.
TYWIN
Jaime cannot marry or inherit
lands. Tyrion’s sentence will be
carried out tomorrow. You have, on
several occasions, made great
claims about your commitment to
this family’s future. Your role in
that future is more vital now than
it ever was.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 14
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
CERSEI
I don’t care. I will stay in King’s
Landing where I belong. With my
son. The King.
Tywin thinks about this ultimatum for a moment.
TYWIN
When you were nine years old, I was
called to the capital. I decided to
take your brother with me, but not
you. Do you remember? You insisted
you would not be left behind at
Casterly Rock, under any
circumstances. And if you recall--
CERSEI
I’m not interested in hearing
another one of your smug stories
about the time you won. This isn’t
going to be one of those times.
Tywin stares at his daughter. She stares back.
TYWIN
Do you think you’ll be the first
person dragged into a Sept and
married against their will?
Cersei came here knowing that this would be her last chance
to avoid an awful fate. She came prepared to go all-in. Now
she does.
CERSEI
When you marched into the throne
room to tell me we’d won the Battle
of Blackwater... do you remember? I
was sitting on the Iron Throne with
Tommen. I was about to give him
essence of nightshade. That’s how
far I was willing to go when I
thought someone awful had come to
take my son away.
(re: Tywin himself)
Someone awful is coming to take him
away. Joffrey’s dead, Myrcella’s
been sold off like livestock, and
now you want to ship me to
Highgarden and steal my boy. My
last boy. You’ll dig your claws in,
and Margaery will dig her claws in,
and you’ll fight over him like
beasts until you rip him apart.
(beat)
I will burn our House to the ground
before I let that happen.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 15
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
TYWIN
And how will you do that?
CERSEI
I’ll tell everyone the truth.
TYWIN
Which truth would that be?
She scrutinizes her father for a long while, until she
realizes it for certain:
CERSEI
You don’t know, do you?
(beat)
You never believed it. How is that
possible?
In what may be the most tense moment of her very tense life
with her father, she cannot suppress a laugh.
CERSEI
What am I saying, of course it’s
possible. How could someone so
consumed by the idea of his family
have any conception what his actual
family was doing?
(beat)
We were right there in front of you
and you didn’t see us. One look in
the past twenty years, one real
look at your own children and you
would have known.
(beat)
Everything they say is true, about
Jaime and me. Your legacy is a lie.
Silence.
TYWIN
I don’t believe you.
She examines his face.
CERSEI
Yes you do.
Cersei turns her back on her father and walks away.
INT. KINGSGUARD CHAMBER - DAY
JAIME LANNISTER looks at his page in the Kingsguard’s white
book, his name prominently featured at the top.
CERSEI

Jaime looks to see her in the doorway, then looks away.
JAIME
You won. One fewer brother. You
must be proud of yourself.
She enters the room, closes the door behind her.
JAIME
There’s really nothing you wouldn’t
do, is there?
She is flush with power off the previous scene. She steps
toward him and answers without hesitation:
CERSEI
For my family? No. Nothing. I would
do things for my family that you
couldn’t imagine.
JAIME
Tyrion is your family.
CERSEI
He is not.
JAIME
You don’t get to choose.
CERSEI
I do. So do you. You can choose the
creature that killed our mother to
come into this world--
JAIME
Are you really mad enough to blame
him for that? He didn’t decide to
kill her, he was an infant--
CERSEI
A disease doesn’t decide to kill
you. All the same, you cut it out
before it does.
She moves in closer still.
CERSEI
So what do you decide? What do you
choose?
She is asking him to make the most difficult choice of his
life. Her recent behavior has made it more difficult still.
JAIME
The things I did to get back to
you... to endure all that, and
return to find you--
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 17
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
She cuts him off by pressing her mouth to his.
CERSEI
I choose you.
JAIME
Those are words.
CERSEI
Yes. Just like the ones I said to
father.
(beat)
I told him.
JAIME
Told him what?
CERSEI
I told him about us.
Jaime has always been the one pushing to bring their
relationship out into the open, but he is dumbstruck.
JAIME
You told him--
CERSEI
I told him I won’t marry Loras
Tyrell. I told him I’m staying
right here, with Tommen, with you.
JAIME
And you think he’ll just accept
that?
CERSEI
Go ask him.
Jaime knows his sister better than anyone in the world. He
doesn’t know how she did it, but he can see that, somehow,
she has brought their father to heel.
JAIME
What did you say?
CERSEI
I don’t want to talk about Tywin
Lannister. I don’t choose Tywin
Lannister, I don’t love Tywin
Lannister. I love my brother, I
love my lover.
She kisses Jaime again.
CERSEI
People will whisper, they’ll make
their jokes... let them.

They’re all so small I can’t even

She kisses him again until they’re both breathless. She pulls
away and starts to unbutton his shirt.
JAIME
Someone will walk in.
She takes his golden hand in her hands.
CERSEI
I don’t care.
She kisses his golden fingers.
He grabs the hair at the back of her head and kisses her, the
way he kissed her at Casterly Rock twenty years ago. He
swings her around and lays her out on the Kingsguard table.
INT. GREAT PYRAMID - AUDIENCE HALL - DAY
DAENERYS TARGARYEN sits on her bench at the top of the steps.
She looks tired. She hasn’t slept much in the past few
nights. GREY WORM and SER BARRISTAN SELMY stand at ease on

Together, the two men help Fennesz up the stairs.
As he nears the top, Grey Worm has a slight smile for
Missandei. Missandei smiles back until she sees Dany
noticing, at which point she suppresses it.
FENNESZ

(Thank you for seeing me, Your
Grace. My name is Fennesz.)
(in perfect English)
I can speak the Common Tongue, if
you wish.
DANY
You speak it very well.
FENNESZ
Before you freed me, I belonged to
Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his
children, I taught them languages
and history. They know a great deal
about your family because of me.
Little Calla is only seven, but she
admires you very much.
DANY
I hope I prove worthy of her
admiration. What can I do for you?
FENNESZ
When you took the city, the
children begged me not to leave the
house, but Master Migdhal and I
agreed that I must. So I lost my
home. Now I live on the streets.
DANY
I’ve outfitted mess halls to feed
all former slaves, and barracks to
shelter them.
FENNESZ
I do not mean to offend, Your
Grace, but these places... I went
to one, for three nights. The young
prey on the old, take what they
want and beat us if we resist. I’d
rather take my chances on the
street.
Dany’s anger upon hearing this is plain.

DANY
My Unsullied will make them safe in
short order, my friend. This I

FENNESZ
Even if they are safe, who would I
be there? What purpose would I
serve? With my Master I was a
teacher, I had the respect and love
of his children.
DANY
What is it that you want from me?
FENNESZ
Your Grace, I ask that you let me
sell myself back to Master Mighdal.
The request shocks Dany into silence for a moment.
DANY
You want to return to a man who
owned you, like a goat or a chair?
FENNESZ
Please, Your Grace. The young may
rejoice in the new world you have
built for them, but for those of us
too old to change, there is only
fear and squalor.
He looks back to the chamber door.
FENNESZ
I am not alone. There are many
outside, waiting to beg the same of
you.
Dany faces a serious conundrum.
DANY
I did not take this city to preside
over the injustice I’ve fought to
destroy. I took it to bring people
freedom.
(beat)
But freedom means making your own
choices. I will allow you to sign a
contract with your former master.
It may not cover a period longer
than a year.
FENNESZ
Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you.

Satisfied, the man heads back down the stairs with Grey
Worm’s help.
BARRISTAN
The Masters will take advantage of
this situation. The men serving
them will be slaves in all but
name.
Dany’s silence acknowledges the ugly fact that there are no
easy choices in this situation.
She’s not happy about it, but she doesn’t know what else to
do for the moment, and a new supplicant is entering her
chamber: a GOATHERD, with a bundle in his arms.
Dany notes the state of this man: his eyes are bloodshot and
dead, his bundle trembles in his arms.
DANY
Approach, my friend.
The man looks at her, uncomprehending.
GOATHERD
(in low Valyrian)
Tha shifang, nya Thal.
(I do not understand, my Queen.)
Dany does not understand his guttural speech: Low Valyrian
again. She looks to Missandei.
MISSANDEI
Ye Thal poghash koth nyesha.
(The Queen says you may approach.)
The man climbs the stairs with his bundle. He is an empty
shell. He looks like the wind would blow him away. He speaks,
and Missandei translates:
GOATHERD

Missandei is confused by what she’s translating, but Dany is
not. She is already looking with foreboding at the bundle in
the man’s arms.

Bones, small bones, charred on the ends. And a little skull.
A child’s remains. It is all Missandei can do to translate.

Dany stares at the horror before her.

Dany sits, toying with one of the necklaces Drogo gave her
long ago.
Missandei stands nearby, and Grey Worm not far away.
DANY
What was her name?
Missandei hesitates, until Dany looks up at her.
MISSANDEI
Zala, your Grace.
DANY
How old was she?

There is something heartbreaking about the number three, in

Finally she stands and heads for the door, issuing a command
to Grey Worm:
DANY

(Meet me at the catacombs.)
Grey Worm nods. Missandei glances at him, worried. He stares
back at her, impassive.
INT. CATACOMBS- DAY
Two roasted goats’ carcasses have been left for the dragons
in the center of the cavernous chamber. The hungry beasts
descend, tearing the goats to pieces and devouring them.
Dany’s babies have grown into powerful monsters. But they’re
still her babies. She crouches by them, stroking their long
necks as they eat, whispering quiet words to soothe them.
They don't notice the massive collars and chains on the
floor, chains normally used to anchor ships.
Dany snaps one collar in place around Viserion’s neck, then
the other around Rhaegal’s, whispering soothing words the
whole time. They're too hungry to notice much or care.
They don't realize their mother is crying.
Dany walks away from them. At the double doors she turns and
looks back at her dragons.
Now the dragons realize something is wrong. They try to shuck
out of their collars but can’t. They cry to her for help.
EXT. CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD - DAY
The castle is crowded with BARATHEON TROOPS wearing the
Flaming Heart sigil.
But the courtyard is given over now to the brothers of the
Night’s Watch. The bodies of all the dead brothers who died
in the battle have been piled onto a tiered funeral pyre.

AEMON
And now their watch is ended.
SAMWELL TARLY hands a torch to MAESTER AEMON and guides the
old man to the pyre, helping him to light the first kindling.
Aemon hands the torch to Sam, who lights more kindling.
Sam hands the torch to Jon, and Jon to Edd, and so on, a
communal lighting of the pyre.
Only JANOS SLYNT refuses the torch, when Edd offers it to
him. Edd hands the torch to OLLY, the next man (boy) in line.
Jon looks up and sees Stannis and Davos standing on the
walkway where Lord Commander Mormont used to watch the
recruits.
SELYSE BARATHEON is here too, watching the ritual with grim
fascination. SHIREEN BARATHEON sits by herself on the landing
by the mess hall, her feet dangling over the edge. There is
something incongruous about a child in Castle Black.
Jon Snow turns his gaze back to the funeral pyre, watching
the flames devour his friends.
He looks up and sees someone through the flames staring right
back at him. A beautiful woman dressed all in red, completely
out of place in the black and white world of Castle Black.
MELISANDRE watches Jon curiously: she sees something
interesting in this young man. It’s impossible to tell if her
smile is admiring or mocking.
INT. CASTLE BLACK - CELL - DAY
Lacking proper cells, the brothers have turned this room into
a makeshift holding cell for TORMUND and two other WILDLING
captives (no Thenns, Thenns don’t get captured alive), who
sit on the floor.

Tormund’s wounds have been bandaged.
The prisoners are all shackled, hands tied behind their
backs. Unlike virtually everyone else in Westeros, the
Night’s Watch knows how to keep prisoners imprisoned.
Jon approaches. Tormund glares up at him.
TORMUND
Your old blind man patched me up.
(off Jon’s nod)
Why?
JON
He’s sworn to treat all wounded
men. Friend or foe.
This is an alien concept to Tormund. There must be a logical
explanation.
TORMUND
You want me alive so you can
torture me?
JON
No one’s going to torture you.
TORMUND
So how do we die? Hanging?
Beheading? Drop us from the top of
the Wall?
JON
I don’t know what happens with the
prisoners.
TORMUND
Who decides?
JON
I suppose Stannis does.
TORMUND

JON

TORMUND

JON
Say farewell.
Tormund glances at his wildling comrades. All of them stare
up at Jon. What the fuck is he talking about?
TORMUND
The dead can’t hear us, boy.
Jon nods. He begins to walk away.
TORMUND
Snow.

Did you love her?
Jon hesitates and then nods.
TORMUND
She loved you.
JON
She told you?
TORMUND
No! All she ever talked about was
killing you. That’s how I know.
Tormund smiles, but he’s not mocking Jon.
TORMUND
She belongs in the North. The real
North. You understand me?
EXT. NORTH OF THE WALL - DAY
A horse is tied to a tree. A sledge is harnessed to the
horse.
Not far from the weirwood tree where he said his vows, Jon
Snow finishes building a small funeral pyre for YGRITTE.

She lies near the top, pale and tiny without her heavy
leather outfit (i.e., wearing light top and trousers).
He kneels beside the pyre and strikes a flint, sparking the
kindling.
He stands back from the flames and stares at her cold little
freckled face.
He closes his eyes. He doesn’t want to watch her burn.
The smoke rises above them, above the weirwood tree and its
canopy of red leaves, higher and higher into the cold blue
sky.
EXT. NORTH OF THE WALL - DAY
Two pairs of ragged feet trudge up a snowy incline, very
close together. One of them is having trouble walking: JOJEN
REED.
MEERA REED props him up, his arm over her shoulder, and helps
him onward. Jojen is in awful shape, pale, sweating despite
the frigid cold, half-delirious.
MEERA
We can stop. We can rest.
JOJEN
Rest with the Three-Eyed Raven.
Ahead of them, HODOR pulls BRAN STARK forward on his sled, as
SUMMER struggles to keep up. Facing Jojen, Bran is worried.
Jojen only smiles.
As Hodor and Bran crest the hill, Jojen stumbles and falls.
Meera kneels beside him.
MEERA
We’re not going to make it.
JOJEN
We’re already here.
BRAN (O.S.)
Jojen! Look!
Meera helps Jojen to his feet, and together they take the
last few steps to join Bran at the hilltop, and see what he
sees:
The distinctive four-peaked hill from Bran’s visions rises up
before them, on the other side of a snowy plain. Two huge and
ancient weirwoods flank a cleft in the rock ahead, trunks
like turret towers, their red leaves bathing a large swath of
the foothills in shadow.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 28
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
They look upon it with awe. This is the reason they’ve all
come together and made this impossible journey. This is their
destination.
No words are spoken. None are needed. Bran looks to Jojen,
who manages a weak smile. Together, they head down the hill,
toward the twin weirwoods.
Dwarfed by the epic landscape, they cover the final stretch
of ground.
The snow is deeper here; Summer is having trouble with it.
We see the weary determination in their faces. Bran
struggling to stay on his sled. The grip of Hodor’s frozen
hands on its handles.
Jojen is swooning, unsteady on his feet. He has to stop.
Bran calls out:
BRAN
Are you alright?
Meera looks at him: are you? Can you make it?
Panting, Jojen nods, and calls upon his last reserves to make
the final push.
He lifts his foot off the snowy ground.
And a skeletal hand bursts from the snow next to it and grabs
his ankle.
Meera struggles to free her brother from the hand’s grasp.
Bran shouts at Hodor:
BRAN
Help them! Now!
Hodor lets go of the sled and runs to Jojen and Meera -- but
another skeletal hand shoots from the snow to block his way,
terrifying the poor giant. He kicks it away.
HODOR
Hodor Hodor Hodor...
Summer steps in next to Bran, growling, on full alert.
Meera manages to free her brother from the creature’s grip,
but the force of her efforts pull them both backwards into
the snow.
And that is where they lie when the WIGHT claws its way out
from its resting place.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 29
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
The wights we have seen until now have been recently turned;
this one is very, very old. Little of its rotten flesh
remains on its bones. A few scraps of leather hang from its
frame. It is armed with the rusty sword with which it was
buried -- a weapon from a different epoch, possibly thousands
of years old.
The creature rises to its feet and comes for Jojen and Meera.
Another WIGHT emerges behind them.
TWO MORE WIGHTS dig their way out of the snow, blocking
Hodor’s way, throwing themselves at him. Hodor stops
“Hodor”ing, and starts screaming, desperately trying to shake
the creatures off.
Bran sees Hodor panicking, and Meera brandishing her dagger.
BRAN
Hodor, stop! Help them!
But Hodor is not helping them. He’s terrified, flailing --
not even noticing that a WIGHT is using the foot of Bran’s
sled to pull itself into the open air, crawling along his
useless legs to get at his throat.
Summer grabs the creature by the neck, hauls it away and
shakes it violently until its head rolls off. Its skeletal
jaws keep clacking; its headless body keeps moving.
The first wight swings at Meera. She ducks the swing and
buries her blade between the wight’s ribs, to no effect. The
thing keeps coming.
Hodor is cowering, useless as the wights close in on him.
Bran steels himself, takes a deep breath, and his eyes go
warg white.
Hodor’s eyes flicker. Bran is inside Hodor now. And Bran is
angry.
Hodor lurches to his feet and hurls the encroaching wights
away like rag-dolls. He fights his way to Jojen and Meera
with the ferocity of an angry bear, driving his massive fists
into the wight's skulls, ripping arms out of sockets.
When Hodor reaches Jojen and Meera, however, Jojen sees the
situation:
THREE WIGHTS are emerging from the snow behind Bran.
FOUR MORE WIGHTS are popping up between Jojen and Bran.
Another FOUR WIGHTS are clawing their way from beneath the
snow behind Jojen.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 30
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
Jojen knows Bran is controlling Hodor; he looks into Hodor’s
eyes, and speaks directly to Bran. [Note: the closeups of
Jojen here should be done in Bran’s warging POV.]
JOJEN
Save yourself.
Bran himself is impassive, white eyes betraying nothing.
But we read Bran’s horror at this suggestion in Hodor’s face.
Hodor moves his mouth to speak, but speaking through Hodor is
something Bran cannot yet do.
JOJEN
Now!
Hodor turns away and heads back to protect Bran.
Meera prepares to fight the incoming wights to the best of
her ability.
Hodor thrashes his way back through the wights that have
popped up between Jojen and Bran.
Meera fights off two wights that are coming for Jojen-- she
does a good job, disarming one of them and using its sword to
hack them both up.
But she doesn’t see the wight scrambling across the ground
for Jojen. She only becomes aware of it when the creature
buries its long knife in Jojen’s belly, and Jojen screams.
The wights behind Bran are closing on him. Hodor isn’t going
to get to Bran in time to save him/himself.
Meera gets to Jojen, pulls the wight off him and beheads it
in a single stroke. She crouches beside her brother, whose
blood is staining the snow red in a widening circle.
MEERA
No. No no no no...
And still more of them are coming for Jojen.
And Bran: the wights behind him are almost upon him, nearer
than Hodor. Stuck in Hodor’s body, Bran is about to watch
himself die in Hodor’s POV.
We’re on an insensate, white-eyed Bran (not in Hodor’s POV)
when the two wights behind him go up in flames.
Bran/Hodor sees this, and wargs back to Bran.
Bran’s irises return, and he turns to see the burning wights
fall, revealing a CHILD OF THE FOREST.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 31

(CONTINUED)
At first glance, she appears to be a small girl. At second
glance, it becomes clear she is not human. Her sharp bone
structure, her slightly elongated proportions, her dappled
skin, her impossibly wide set eyes.
In her hand: a small clay globe. She throws it at an emerging
wight and the creature bursts into flames, covered in magical
napalm.
Her voice is not that of a child and not that of an adult:
CHILD OF THE FOREST
Come with me, Brandon Stark. There
are more. There are always more.
Jojen sees the Child of the Forest, and the wights that are
closing on him and Meera. Meera tries to move him.
Impossible.
She screams to Bran and Hodor and the Child.
MEERA
Help me! Help me!
CHILD OF THE FOREST
He’s lost. Come with me or die with
him.
The Child is neither afraid nor mournful. Her task here is
saving Brandon Stark. Everyone else is irrelevant.
Meera looks down to her dying brother, unwilling to let him
go. But Jojen nods at her: do it. Live for both of us.
Crying, Meera knows it’s true. He stares into her eyes and
nods once, slowly.
She kisses her brother on the forehead. And beneath the
frame, she cuts his throat.
She flees toward Bran, Hodor and Summer, following the Child
of the Forest up the incline, to the mouth of the cave
between the two weirwoods. The wights pursue them.
They can only move so fast with Bran on his sled. And the
wights are gaining.
The Child of the Forest’s last act before entering the cave:
she throws a clay globe at Jojen’s body, lighting it up,
robbing the White Walkers of one more piece of grist for
their mill.
They enter the cave.

A wight tries to follow them, but the moment it crosses the
threshold, the force that animates and holds it together
ceases to work. The skeleton collapses, bones clattering on
the ground.
INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS
Bran sees this happen. As he pulls around the corner of the
cave tunnel, another wight follows and suffers the same fate.
Bran, Hodor, Meera and Summer follow the Child of the Forest
down through the low twisty tunnel. Weirwood roots slither in
and out of the earthen walls like white snakes.
Meera is shattered. Jojen is dead. Her reason for being has
been taken away.
The tunnel is difficult for Hodor to maneuver, and the
weirwood roots freak him out.
BRAN
Hurry, Hodor.
CHILD OF THE FOREST
They cannot follow us here. The
power that moves them is powerless
here.
The weirwood roots grow thicker as they go.
BRAN
Who are you?
CHILD OF THE FOREST
The First Men called us the
Children. We were born long before
them.

Come. He waits for you.
The passage eventually opens up into a huge cavern, barely
lit by thin shafts of light breaking through the root
ceiling.
As they proceed, the floor beneath them is littered with
bones. Ravens perch here and there, hopping from skull to
skull, staring at the newcomers.
Looking to one side, Bran sees that the cave network extends
far beyond this chamber, lit with similar shafts of light.
And in the distance, figures move into and out of those
shafts of light: other Children of the Forest, glimpsing at
the newcomers before disappearing into the darkness.
They move toward a thick pillar of twisted roots, visible to
them only in silhouette.

The Child of the Forest drops one of her clay globes in a
rough brazier of black volcanic rock near the base of the
root structure, revealing:
The THREE-EYED RAVEN.
A pale man in tattered black clothes sits in a tangled nest
of roots -- a woven weirwood throne that wraps around his
limbs. The roots have grown over him, under him, and through
him, burrowed through his limbs and come out the other side.
His hair is white and filament-thin, his skin pale white and
stretch taut across his face like leather. The only part of
him that really seems alive is his eyes.

You’re the Three-Eyed Raven.

POD
I hobbled them last night.
Pod searches for a horse that might be hiding under a rock
while Brienne stares at him.
BRIENNE
What sort of hobble?
Pod knows he’s in serious trouble. He’s not giving up the
search, even though there’s no possible place for a horse to
be hiding.

ARYA STARK stands in the middle of the road practicing her
fighting moves.
Her pony and the Hound’s horse, Stranger, are tied up not far
away.
Unlike the last time we saw Arya (when the Hound mocked her),
her swordplay now is less theatrical. Fewer flourishes and
spins, more deadly thrusts.
She stops when she hears footsteps coming from down the road.
She keeps her voice low as she calls to the Hound, who isn’t
visible from here.
ARYA
People coming.

You can shit later, there’s people
coming.
Brienne emerges around a bend in the road, followed a few
seconds later by Pod, who has sweat clean through his clothes
as he trudges forward under the weight of the saddle bags.
Arya waits for them in the middle of the road, Needle in
hand. She looks ready for a fight.
But when she realizes that Brienne is a woman her expression
changes. She’s never seen a woman in armor before.
Brienne nods as she approaches.

This comment has the exact opposite effect on Arya than
Brienne might have expected. Arya’s face hardens.
ARYA
My mother’s dead.
BRIENNE
I know. I wish I’d been there to
protect her.
ARYA
You’re not a northerner.
Brienne is not very good at soothing troubled young girls.
She tries to convince Arya by simply telling the truth, but
the truth is not very convincing.

BRIENNE
No. But I swore sacred vow to
protect your mother--
ARYA
Why didn’t you?
Brienne hesitates. She knows this won’t sound good to Arya.
BRIENNE
She commanded me to bring Jaime
Lannister back to King’s Landing.
HOUND
You’re paid by the Lannisters? You
here for the bounty on me?
BRIENNE
I am not paid by the Lannisters.
HOUND
No? Fancy sword you got there.
Where’d you get it?
(off Brienne’s silence)
I been looking at Lannister gold
all my life. Go on, Brienne of
fucking Tarth. Tell me that’s not
Lannister gold.
Arya waits for an answer from Brienne. Finally:
BRIENNE
Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
Arya steps to the side of the road, clearing space for
Brienne.
ARYA
The Bloody Gate’s ten miles.
BRIENNE
I swore to your mother, by the old
gods --
ARYA
I don’t care what you swore.
BRIENNE
Arya--
HOUND
You heard the girl. She’s not
coming with you.
BRIENNE
She is.

The Hound draws his sword eight inches clear of its scabbard.
HOUND
You’re not a good listener.
Brienne draws her sword eight inches clear of its scabbard.
The Hound is impressed.
HOUND
That Valyrian steel? I always
wanted some Valyrian steel.
BRIENNE
Come with me, Arya. I’ll take you
to safety.
HOUND
Safety? Where the fuck’s that? Her
aunt in the Eyrie is dead. Her
mother’s dead. Her father’s dead.
Her brother’s dead. Winterfell’s a
pile of rubble. There is no safety,
you dumb bitch. You don’t know that
by now, you’re the wrong one to
watch over her.
BRIENNE
And that’s what you’re doing?
Watching over her?
HOUND
Aye. That’s what I’m doing.
He draws his sword clean of the scabbard. Brienne draws hers.
Pod backs away. So does Arya.
The Hound charges and swings. Brienne is immediately on the
defensive. As good as she is, she’s never fought anyone as
strong or ferocious as Sandor Clegane.
Again and again the Hound hacks at her and Brienne is barely
able to fend him off.
Arya watches, not entirely sure who she’s rooting for.
Pod watches, fairly sure he’s going to be unemployed soon.
Several times in the opening seconds of the fight it looks as
if the Hound might be able to score a quick kill.
But Brienne holds him off and the Hound, already weakened
from his infected wounds, soon begins to tire.
Before long Brienne is able to match him blow for blow.

(CONTINUED)
The Hound is panting now, sweating despite the cold, his hair
plastered down over his burnt face, taking deep breaths.
[At some point during this fight Arya should no longer be
visible, but we should not see her slip away.]
Brienne knows if she can keep the fight going a little longer
she’ll wear her opponent down and defeat him. She’s content
to fight conservatively and let him make the first mistake.
The Hound knows he doesn’t have much time left. He launches a
desperate final attack, raining blows down on the cool and
composed Brienne, who blocks every one.
On the final parry Brienne slashes the Hound’s right wrist
and he drops his sword.
She levels the point of her sword at his heart.
BRIENNE
I have no wish to kill you, ser.
HOUND
I’m not a knight.
He grabs her sword in his gloved hands and holds on tight,
though the blade bites into his palms and blood begins to
flow, for long enough to bash her in the throat with his
forearm and grab her in a bear hug.
Even sick and exhausted he’s still far stronger than she is.
She’s unable to lift her sword arm.
He slams his forehead into her nose and now Brienne’s
bleeding and dazed.
He tries for another headbutt to finish her off but Brienne
jerks her head to the side so he doesn’t land. She bites down
hard on his ear.
The Hound snarls and Brienne bites and finally spits out a
wad of bloody ear.
The Hound manages to wrestle her to the ground, her sword
falling away, and they grapple on the rocks, punching and
kicking at each other, tumbling closer to a steep cliff.
The Hound manages to pull his dagger. Before he can cut her
with it, Brienne grabs a rock and clocks the Hound in the
side of the head.
The Hound topples over, bleeding quite a bit now. But the
Hound won’t quit until he’s dead. He staggers to his feet and
charges at her again.
Brienne sidesteps and smashes him again in the side of the
head with the rock.

The Hound falls to his knees. Brienne kicks him in the face,
hard.
The Hound falls over the edge of the ravine, tumbling down
the steep rocky face and lying still at the base of the
ravine.
Brienne stands on the edge of the ravine and looks down at
him. He’s not moving.
She gathers up her sword and turns for Arya.
But Arya’s not here anymore.
BRIENNE
Where is she?
Pod, stunned by the fight he’s just seen, looks around.
POD
She was just here!
BRIENNE
Why weren’t you watching her?
POD
I was watching you, I... I thought
you might need help.
BRIENNE
Which way, Pod! Which way did she
go?
POD
I... I think that way.
Brienne, bloodied and furious, marches in that direction.
BRIENNE
Arya! ARYA!
Pod picks up the saddle bags and chases after her.
But Arya hasn’t gone down the road, or up the road. She has
scrambled to the top of a rock formation above the road.
We find her up there now, waiting until Brienne and Pod are
safely out of sight.
Then she scrambles down the rocky face and into the ravine.
EXT. RAVINE - DAY
Arya approaches the Hound.
He’s still breathing but he doesn’t look good.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 42
CONTINUED: (6)
(CONTINUED)
One of his legs is broken, the pale bone peeking through his
torn pants.
His eyes are closed, his face battered and his breathing
uneven.
Arya knows how dangerous wounded dogs can be. She approaches
carefully, not getting too close, her hand on Needle’s hilt.
He opens his eyes when he hears her.
HOUND
You’re still here?
He coughs. Flecks of blood come up with his sputum. He sees
the blood. He knows what it means.
HOUND
Big bitch saved you.
ARYA
Don’t need saving.
HOUND
No, not you. You’re a real killer.
With your water dancing. And your
Needle.
ARYA
You gonna die?
HOUND
Unless there’s a maester hiding
behind that rock. Aye, I’m done.
(coughs again)
I’d skin you alive for wine.
She offers him a water skin.
HOUND
Fuck water.
He shifts slightly, trying to find a less painful position.
But there is no less painful position.
HOUND
Killed by a woman. Bet you like
that. Go on, go after her, she’ll
help you.
Arya gives a slow shake of her head.
HOUND
Going it alone? You won’t last a
day out there.
Arya stares at him, cold and pitiless.

ARYA
I’ll last longer than you.
The Hound grins, his teeth wet with blood. He can't argue
with that.
HOUND
You remember where the heart is?
She nods.
The Hound takes a deep breath and looks into the sky. There
are no meaningful birds. There’s nothing to look at but rocks
and sky and Arya Stark.
HOUND
Fuck it all. I’m ready.
Arya doesn’t move. The Hound mistakes her motionlessness for
timidity.
HOUND
Go on, girl. Another name off your
list. You kept promising me.
Arya still doesn’t move. The Hound sees that he’ll need to
provoke her to murder.
HOUND
I cut down that butcher’s boy of
yours, the ginger. He was begging
for mercy. “Please, ser, please
don’t kill me, please, please.”
Bled all over my horse. Saddle
stunk of butcher boy for weeks.
Arya watches him, silent.
HOUND
And your sister... your pretty
sister... I should have taken her.
That night the Blackwater burned. I
should have fucked her bloody. At
least I'd have one happy memory.
But Arya will not be provoked. She stares down at the Hound
as he grimaces, the pain becoming overwhelming, the sweat
dripping down his face.
HOUND
You want me to beg you? Do it.
At last Arya crouches down beside him. We think she’s finally
going to kill him but instead she takes his coin purse [the
same one the Hound stole from Mortimer the Farmer in 403.]

When the Hound realizes what she’s doing he grabs for her,
but she’s too quick for him in his weakened state.
She rises and walks away, clambering up the ravine. The Hound
screams after her.
HOUND
Kill me! Kill me! KILL ME!
Arya walks toward her horse, her face emotionless as the
Hound screams, never looking back.
INT. TYRION’S CELL - NIGHT
TYRION LANNISTER lies on the pallet on the floor, his cell
lit only by weak moonlight leaking in through the barred
window.
He stares at the ceiling. It has been a long and sleepless
night.
He hears footsteps approaching and sees torchlight under the
door. He stands and steels himself for the last minutes of
his life.
The key rattles in the lock and the door creaks inward.
Tyrion raises a hand to shield his eyes from the light.
TYRION
Get on with it, you son of a whore.
JAIME
Is that any way to speak about our
mother?
Tyrion stares at Jaime, standing silhouetted in the doorway.
The torch rests in a bracket in the hallway behind him.
TYRION
What are you doing?
Jaime swings the key chain around his finger.
JAIME
What do you think I’m doing?
INT. CORRIDOR BY TYRION’S CELL - - NIGHT
Jaime leads Tyrion out of the cell.
JAIME
A galley’s waiting in the bay,
bound for the Free Cities.

They step around two unconscious GUARDS lying on the floor.
TYRION
Who’s helping you?
JAIME
Varys.
The last time Tyrion saw Varys the eunuch was betraying him
during the trial.
TYRION
Varys?
JAIME
You have more friends than you
thought.
INT. TUNNELS BENEATH THE RED KEEP - NIGHT
They reach a stairway leading upwards. Jaime stops here and
fixes the torch in a sconce.
JAIME
(re: staircase)
There’s a locked door at the top of
the stairs. Knock on it twice, then
twice again. Varys will open.
Tyrion nods. Neither man knows what to say to the other.
TYRION
I suppose this is goodbye, then.
Jaime goes to one knee and kisses Tyrion on each cheek.
The unexpected tenderness startles Tyrion.
JAIME
Farewell, little brother.
Jaime stands and starts to go.
TYRION
Jaime.
Jaime turns.
TYRION
Thank you. For my life.
Jaime smiles and gestures to the stairs.
JAIME
Quickly now.

Jaime walks away, disappearing into the darkness.
Tyrion watches him go. He doesn’t expect to ever see his
older brother again.
When Jaime is gone, Tyrion looks up the stairs. Escape lies
that way. Life and freedom.
But he has other business to deal with first.
INT. TYWIN LANNISTER’S OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT
Tyrion emerges from a cleverly hidden trapdoor in Tywin’s
complex atop the Tower of the Hand.
He walks past the Small Council table, where Tywin shamed him
many times. Past the desk, where Tywin shamed him many times.
INT. TYWIN’S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
A dark-haired woman lies atop the bedclothes, her face turned
away from us, naked save for the golden chains she wears
round her neck.
On a wood board atop the bedside table there’s a halved
apple, cheese, and a small, sharp knife.
Staring at the naked woman, not really believing who she is,
Tyrion walks quietly toward the bed.
Not quietly enough.
SHAE
Tywin? My lion?
She turns with a smile on her face. The smile disappears when
she sees Tyrion.
For a long beat they stare at each other, neither one
believing what they’re seeing.
Then everything moves very quickly.
SHAE reaches for the little blade on the bedside table.
Tyrion lunges forward, getting on top of her and grabbing for
her wrist as she swings at his face.
She cuts his hand and swings again but he manages to catch
her wrist on the second swing.
She claws at him with her free hand, ferocious, all the love
she once had for him now turned to hatred for the man who
betrayed her.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 47
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Tyrion twists her knife hand and Shae gasps, dropping the
knife.
She grabs for his face, trying to claw his eyes out.
Tyrion gets hold of the gold chains she wears as a necklace.
The gift he gave her not so long ago.
Shae rakes his face while he twists the gold chains and
begins to strangle her.
Shae is a fighter. Her nails draw blood. But Tyrion is a
fighter, too, and a condemned man.
He pulls the chains with all his strength, cutting off Shae’s
air. Blood drips onto her from his slashed hand.
Shae’s face is red from lack of air. Soon her struggles
weaken.
Lost in his own rage, Tyrion pulls the chains tighter and
tighter until he realizes that Shae is motionless, her eyes
open but unseeing.
He releases her. Now that she’s dead his anger seeps away and
he stares with horror at the woman he loved.
He touches her hand but it’s limp, lifeless. He sits beside
her and begins to cry. At this moment he doesn’t care if he
survives the night.
TYRION
I’m sorry... I’m sorry I’m sorry.
Part of him wants to get caught right now, for gold cloaks to
rush into the room and arrest him. But he looks up and sees a
crossbow on the wall [the same crossbow Joffrey demonstrated
to Margaery in Season 3].
The night’s not over yet. Tyrion pulls the silk quilt over
Shae’s body, shrouding her.
He walks over to the crossbow.
INT. TOWER OF THE HAND HALLWAY - NIGHT
Tyrion walks down a dark hall lit by flickering sconces, a
look of grim purpose on his face. He holds the crossbow,
already cocked, a quarrel in the notch.
He reaches a closed door. Light shines under the doorway.
Both hands on the crossbow, Tyrion nudges the door open with
his foot.

INT. PRIVY - NIGHT
Tywin sits in the dimness of the privy tower, bed robe hiked
up around his hips. At the sound of the door opening, he
raises his eyes.
If Tywin’s afraid, he shows no sign.
TYWIN
Tyrion.
Tyrion says nothing. His face bleeds where Shae raked him.
His hand bleeds where she cut him.
TYWIN
Put down that crossbow.
Tyrion shakes his head slowly. After everything, he’s still
afraid of his father.
TYWIN
Who released you?
(off Tyrion’s silence)
Your brother, I expect. He always
had a soft spot for you. Come,
we’ll go and talk in my chambers--
Tywin moves to stand but Tyrion raises the crossbow, quarrel
pointed at Tywin’s heart.
Tywin remains seated, a small smile on his face.
TYWIN
This is how you want to speak to
me?
Tyrion gives a very small nod.
TYWIN
Shaming your father has always
given you pleasure.
TYRION
All my life, you’ve wanted me dead.
A silence between father and son. If Tyrion’s expecting an
apology, he’s not going to get one.
TYWIN
Yes.
(beat)
But you refuse to die. I respect
that. Admire it, even. You fight
for what’s yours.
Tyrion says nothing, crossbow still aimed right at Tywin.

TYWIN
I’d never let them execute you. Is
that what you fear? You think I’d
let Ilyn Payne take your head?
You’re a Lannister! You’re my son.
TYRION
I loved her.
TYWIN
Who?
TYRION
Shae.
TYWIN
Tyrion. Put down the crossbow.
Tyrion shakes his head.
TYRION
I murdered her. With my own hands.
TYWIN
That doesn’t matter--
TYRION
Doesn’t matter?
TYWIN
She was a whore.
TYRION
(raising crossbow)
Say that word again...
TYWIN
And you’ll what? Kill your own
father in the privy? No. You’re my
son. Now enough of this nonsense--
TYRION
I’m your son. And you sentenced me
to die. You knew I didn’t poison
Joffrey. But you sentenced me all
the same. Why?
TYWIN
Enough of this. We’ll go back to my
chambers and speak with some
dignity--
TYRION
I can’t go back there. She’s there.

TYWIN
(rising)
You’re afraid of a dead whore--
Tyrion’s finger clenches. The crossbow whangs just as Tywin
starts to rise. The bolt slams into his belly and Tywin sits
back down with a grunt.
The quarrel has sunk deep, right to the fletching. Blood
seeps out around the shaft.
TYWIN
You shot me.
The pain is shocking, but even more so the realization for
Tywin that this is where he will die, sitting on the privy,
murdered by his own child.
Tyrion loads another bolt.
TYWIN
You are no son of mine.
TYRION
I am your son. I’ve always been
your son.
Tyrion shoots his father in the heart.
He turns and walks away, dropping the crossbow on the floor
as he goes. Behind him, Tywin’s head slumps and his body goes
slack.
INT. DIMLY LIT RED KEEP LANDING - NIGHT
VARYS stands by a bolted door. When he hears two knocks, then
two knocks again, he unbolts the door and opens it to find
Tyrion, bleeding from the face and hand.
VARYS
What have you done?
Tyrion shakes his head. He doesn’t want to talk.
None of this was part of the plan, but Varys is already pot
committed. He closes the door and rebolts it.
VARYS
Quickly.
He leads Tyrion away.

INT. VARYS’ CHAMBER - NIGHT
A large wooden crate with air holes rests on the floor. It
looks exactly like the crate that contained a sorcerer in S3.
Tyrion does not want to get into that crate.
VARYS
Trust me, my friend. I’ve brought
you this far.
Tyrion takes a deep breath and steps inside the crate, with
the aid of a footstool and Varys’ hand.
There is some straw in the crate to make it a bit more
comfortable, along with a drinking gourd and a bundle wrapped
with string.
Once Tyrion’s positioned he looks up at Varys and nods.
Varys lifts the lid of the crate and fixes it into position,
leaving Tyrion in darkness, alone save for the sound of his
own breathing and the thwack, thwack as Varys nails the lid
in place.
EXT. KING’S LANDING HARBOR - NIGHT
Two BURLY LONGSHOREMEN carry the crate across the gangplank
and onto the deck of a merchant ship, setting it alongside
other crates just like it.
Varys watches from the dock. He glances up at the Red Keep,
looming above the sleeping city.
Varys sighs. He’s grown rather fond of the dirty old town.
But now it’s time to leave. He walks across the gangplank,
onto the deck of the ship, hands in his sleeves, ignoring the
SAILORS who bustle around him.
He stands next to Tyrion’s crate as the longshoremen step off
the ship and the sailors pull in the gangplank.
EXT. SALTPANS - DAY
Arya rides her pony toward the docks of a small port town.

The Captain glances at her.
CAPTAIN
No you don’t.
ARYA
I can pay.
She offers the Captain the coin purse she took from the
Hound. The Captain doesn’t bother taking the purse.
CAPTAIN
There’s nothing in the north but
ice and war and pirates.
ARYA
I wouldn’t need a cabin.
The Captain isn’t an unkind man, he’s just a busy one who
doesn’t have time to speak with a strange urchin girl. He
starts to walk away. Arya pursues him.
ARYA
Please. I could work. Scrubbing the
floors, or--
CAPTAIN
I’m not going north, child. I’m
going home.
Arya looks around the small harbor, a stranger in a strange
land with nowhere to go.

Arya stands at the stern as the ship sails out to sea. She
watches Westeros recede behind her. In a single masterful
crane shot that secures the camera operator’s legendary
status, we follow Arya as she walks to the bow, gracefully
sidestepping the busy sailors.
Standing by the figurehead (a gilded naked woman), Arya looks
east, across the waves to whatever comes next.
