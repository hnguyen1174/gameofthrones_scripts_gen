EXT. BEYOND THE WALL - DAY
JON SNOW’s black-booted feet march across the tramped snow,
past DEAD WILDLINGS -- cut down with arrows, smashed with
rocks.
And the corpse of DONGO THE DOOMED, fallen giant. Ravens now
feed on his flesh.
Jon stops. He looks back over his left shoulder, where the
scythe-smashed bodies of the WILDLINGS who tried to climb the
Wall lie in a pile of broken and twisted limbs.
He looks forward to his right, where Mag’s flaming bull
mammoth stomped a swath through the wildling ranks in his
panicked final moments, leaving piles of CRUSHED WILDLINGS in
his wake. Faint wisps of smoke still rise from the animal’s
charred carcass.
Then Jon looks straight ahead, across the no-man’s-land
between the Wall and the woods. Somewhere in those woods lies
his destination: Mance’s camp.
Jon continues forward on the longest walk of his life.
EXT. TOP OF THE WALL - DAY
DOLOROUS EDD watches Jon, a speck of black against the snow,
as he disappears into the woods.
In the distance, Mance’s forest fire burns on, sending a
steady curtain of black smoke into the sky.
EXT. FOREST - OUTSKIRTS OF MANCE’S CAMP - DAY
Through the trees ahead Jon sees the outskirts of Mance’s
camp: a sprawling jumble of tents and cookfires and latrine
pits, children and goats wandering freely, sheep bleating
among the trees, horse hides pegged up to dry. No plan to it,
no order. Men and women and animals everywhere.
You don’t sneak up on wildlings in the woods: the WILDLING
MEN in front of Jon have been waiting for him, weapons in
hand. As have the WILDLING MEN who emerge from the trees
behind him.
Jon raises his hands above his head.
Saying nothing, the wildlings approach him and pat him down
for weapons, of which he has none. Then they shove him
forward toward the camp.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 1
EXT. MANCE’S CAMP - DAY
Jon marches forward, surrounded by his wildling guards. He’s
in the middle of the camp now, and everyone stops what
they’re doing to stare at him when he passes:
CHILDREN squatting by the fires. OLD WOMEN feeding dogs. CAVE
PEOPLE with painted faces. RAIDERS with claws and snakes and
severed heads painted on their shields. SPEARWIVES with long
hair that streams in the wind.
They’ve all lost friends and family to the Night’s Watch in
the previous day’s battle. They would all like to tear Jon to
pieces. But no one lays a hand on him. No one spits or throws
rocks or says a word.
As he proceeds, however, many look from Jon to his final
destination. Seeing them, Jon looks too -- to Mance’s polar
bear tent, set on a higher elevation than the others.
The entrance to the tent is fronted by a semi-circle of
WILDLING CHIEFTAINS, the leaders of each of the disparate
tribes that have been unified into a single army under
Mance’s leadership. The distinctness and specificity of their
costume and makeup is stunning.
Their weapons are all at the ready as Jon is brought before
them and halted with a rough hand to the shoulder.
MANCE RAYDER emerges from this tent. He’s not surprised by
Jon’s presence; word of his arrival has evidently preceded
him.
MANCE
You’re wearing a black cloak again.
JON
I’ve been sent to negotiate with
you.
Jon nods. He is definitely one of the two, or both.
Mance opens the tent and motions Jon inside. Jon enters. Six
of the chieftains follow him.
INT. MANCE'S TENT - CONTINUOUS
The day is bright but the tent is dim, lit only by a small
cookfire and a light glow from the translucent walls. A goat
slowly roasts over the fire.
The chieftains take up their places, evenly spaced around the
perimeter of the walls. Thinking about his self-appointed
mission -- killing Mance -- Jon clocks their fearsome
weapons. But the wildlings have them firmly in hand.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 2
(CONTINUED)
A simple wooden table sits in the middle of the tent, a threelegged stool on either side of it.
Mance enters last and steps past Jon. Jon’s eyes drop to
Mance’s sword, hanging from his side. Coming closer to Jon.
As Mance’s sword passes within inches of Jon’s sword hand,
Jon’s hand opens, weighing an immediate strike...
But he hesitates for a beat, and the opportunity passes as
Mance does. Mance steps to the table and sits on the stool
facing the tent entrance. He motions to the other stool.
Jon sits opposite Mance.
MANCE
It appears my trusting nature got
the better of me. It’s happened
before. I was hoping your loyalty
was real when you pledged yourself
to us, Jon Snow. Truly I was.
JON
The Halfhand ordered me to join
your army and bring back whatever
information I could to Castle
Black. He made me kill him so you’d
trust me.
(beat)
I was loyal: to him. And to my
Night’s Watch vows.
MANCE
All of them?
Mance has divined the obvious. Jon lowers his eyes.
MANCE
She wasn’t enough to turn you, eh?
(off his silence)
Were you enough to turn her?
JON
She put three arrows in me when I
escaped.
MANCE
Did you see her again at Castle
Black?
JON
Yes.
MANCE
And?

(CONTINUED)
JON
She’s dead.
MANCE
Your doing?
JON
No.
Killed by a young boy, but Jon doesn’t want to mention that.
MANCE
That’s for the best.
(beat)
Let’s drink to her.
He nods to a Chieftain. Jon notes the man sliding his hand
axe into his belt so he can pour two wooden cups of fermented
milk from a skin.
Jon’s hands flex beneath the table.
Unfortunately for Jon, when the chieftain comes to give them
the drink, he chooses the side of the table that puts the axe
next to Mance, not Jon.
Mance raises his cup. Jon looks warily at his own cup for a
moment. Mance smiles.
MANCE
Of all the ways I’d kill you,
poison would be the last.
He raises his cup.
MANCE
To Ygritte.
JON
To Ygritte.
They drink. Jon cannot hide the fact that fermented milk
tastes like day-old cock cheese. Mance laughs at his wincing
and coughing.
JON
That’s not wine.
MANCE
No, Jon Snow. That’s a proper
Northern drink.
(beat)
You did well. Fought hard, killed
some of our strongest men.
(beat)

(CONTINUED)
One of our giants went into your
tunnel and never came out again.
Mag the Mighty.
JON
He’s dead. He killed my friend
Grenn.
MANCE
Mag was their king, you know. The
last of a bloodline that stretches
back before the First Men.
JON
Grenn came from a farm.
Mance raises his cup.
MANCE
Mag and Grenn.
JON
Grenn and Mag.
Mance drains his cup and Jon does the same.
Mance turns to a different CHIEFTAIN:
MANCE
Kullback, could I trouble you for
something to eat? I don’t imagine
our guest has eaten anything for
quite some time.
The wildling chieftain goes over to the fire and fetches a
nasty looking carving knife. He begins carving slices from
the roasting goat’s haunch.
MANCE
So you’re here to strike a bargain.
JON
Turn your army around and go home.
Mance chuckles.
The chieftain finishes carving the goat and slams the carving
knife into a chopping block. He carries the sliced goat in
his bare hands to Mance and Jon.
The knife remains in the carving block, six feet from Jon.
Nothing stands between the carving knife and Jon.
Mance scrutinizes him.

MANCE (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
MANCE
You know that I know you’re low on
arrows, low on oil, low on men. How
many are left? Fifty?
JON
I told Tormund and Orell. We have
more than a thousand.
Mance shakes his head.
MANCE
I showed you everything I had, my
whole army, a hundred thousand
strong. And what did you do? You
fired on us -- with everything you
had. It wasn’t much.
Jon’s eyes flit to the carving knife when Mance looks away.
MANCE
As soon as I saw that, I sent four
hundred men to climb the Wall, an
unmanned stretch five miles west of
here. A lot of them will die
climbing, but most will make it
over by the end of the day.
(beat)
Here’s me being honest with you,
Jon Snow, which is more than you’ve
ever done for me. My people have
bled enough. I’m not here to
conquer. I’m here to hide behind
your Wall, just like you. We need
your tunnel. Now, we both know
that winter is coming. If my people
don’t get south of the Wall before
it comes in earnest, we’ll all end
up worse than dead.
Jon is here to do a dirty job. But Mance is telling the
truth, and Jon knows it. Which doesn’t make Jon’s job any
easier.
MANCE
You want to strike a bargain with
me? Here’s the bargain: you go back
and open the gates to us, and I
swear to you that no one else will
die. No more raids, no more
killing.
(beat)
Refuse and we’ll kill every last
man in Castle Black.
Jon’s eyes dart to the knife again. This time Mance sees it,
and it all becomes clear.

(CONTINUED)
MANCE
Ah. That’s why you’re here.
His chieftains pick up on his meaning and ready their weapons
-- but he stays their hands with a gesture.
Mance doesn’t go for his own sword. On the contrary, he puts
his hands on the table. He looks to the knife, then back to
Jon.
MANCE
I reckon you could do it before any
of them could stop you. They’d kill
you, of course, they’d kill you
slow. But you knew that when you
came in here.
Jon looks to the knife openly now, and to the men who will
torture him to death if he goes for it, whether or not he
succeeds in killing Mance.
MANCE
Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?
Killing a man in his own tent when
he’s just offered you peace? Is
that what the Night’s Watch is? Is
that what you are?
Yes. Here and now, that is what Jon is. His eyes, his
breathing, the tensing of his legs and arms and fingers are
all telling us so. He is getting ready to kill and to die.
And outside the tent, a horn blows.
The chieftains look to each other and to Mance.
Mance stands and draws on Jon, bringing his blade tip within
inches of Jon’s face.
MANCE
Are you attacking us?
JON
No. It’s just like you said. We
don’t have the men.
MANCE
If you’re lying to me, you’re a
dead man.
Mance storms from the tent, followed by his chieftains. Two
of them grab Jon Snow and drag him along.

EXT. MANCE'S CAMP - CONTINUOUS
Jon emerges to find utter chaos. People running every which
way. Wildlings fleeing into the fog, some of them throwing
down their weapons in panic.
MANCE
Hold! To me! To me!
It’s no use. The downside of freedom is how easily it falls
apart. Mance’s generals form up around him, however,
protecting their leader.
The source of the threat is ahead, to the east; whatever
people are running from is coming from that direction. We
hear it before we see it: trumpets, not war horns. The heavy
footfalls of armored horses and clangor of full plate.
And then they break through the fog: a great, well-formed
column of heavy cavalry, charging up the middle of the
wildling encampment like a spear of horseflesh and black
steel. They’re cutting down the wildlings, setting fire to
their tents, driving implacably forward.
And flying the burning heart banner of Stannis Baratheon.
Mance and Jon look to the left, where another cavalry column
is coming at them in the same fashion. The same on the right.
A pincer maneuver designed to do one thing: encircle Mance
Rayder.
Which they do presently, 100 HEAVILY ARMORED MEN surrounding
fourteen or so wildlings in skins and furs.
And down the middle of the center column, STANNIS BARATHEON
comes riding, with DAVOS SEAWORTH riding at his side and an
HONOR GUARD of Baratheon knights.
But the Free Folk don’t give up their freedom easily. A few
spit in the snow, hefting their weapons, ready to die
fighting.
Stannis was expecting as much. He draws his sword, signaling
the attack.
His mounted men attack.
Mance’s men defend their king. Members of a dozen different
tribes who have been killing each other for centuries, all
prepared to die for this man.
And die they do. With their armor, their horses and their
numbers, Stannis’ men are too much for Mance’s honor guard.
One by one, the leaders of the wildling tribes begin to fall.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 8
(CONTINUED)
One of the chieftains presses a dagger to Jon’s throat. If
this ends badly for them, it is going to end badly for Jon as
well. He prepares to cut Jon’s throat.
MANCE
Stand down.
They all look to him, making sure.
MANCE
Stand down. I said my people have
bled enough, and I meant it.
Mance throws his sword at Stannis’ feet. He looks to his men,
and they all throw down their weapons as well.
The wildling chieftain lets Jon go.
Stannis’ men look to their own king. He sheathes his sword,
dismounts, and approaches Mance. Davos dismounts behind him
and follows his king.
STANNIS
You’re the King Beyond the Wall.
Mance offers a nod but nothing more.
STANNIS
Do you know who I am?
MANCE
Never had the pleasure.
DAVOS
This is Stannis Baratheon, the one
true king of the Seven Kingdoms.
MANCE
We’re not in the Seven Kingdoms.
And you’re not dressed for this
weather.
STANNIS
It is customary to kneel when
surrendering to a king.
MANCE
We do not kneel.
STANNIS
I’ll have thousands of your men in
chains by nightfall. I’ve got
nowhere to put them. I’ve got
nothing to feed them.
(beat)

(CONTINUED)
I’m not here to slaughter beat
dogs. Their fate depends on their
king.
MANCE
All the same. We do not kneel.
Stannis stares at Mance for a beat before gesturing to his
subordinates.
STANNIS
Take these men away.
As Stannis’ men begin taking the prisoners, Davos notices Jon
Snow and points him out to Stannis.
DAVOS
Your Grace.
Stannis sees Jon and turns toward him.
DAVOS
What’s a man of the Night’s Watch
doing in a wildling camp?
JON
I was sent to discuss terms with
the King Beyond the Wall.
DAVOS
You’re speaking to the one true
King, boy. You will address him as
Your Grace.
JON
I know he’s the King. My father
died for him.
(to Stannis)
My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.
I’m Ned Stark’s son.
For the moment, Jon has become more interesting to Stannis
than the King Beyond the Wall.
STANNIS
Your father was an honorable man.
JON
He was, Your Grace.
STANNIS
(re: Mance)
What do you think your father would
have done with him?
Jon looks to Mance, whom he had been on the verge of killing
minutes ago.

STANNIS (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
Mance and the wildling chieftains all look to Jon; Stannis
doesn’t seem like the kind of man who asks a question if he’s
not interested in the answer.
JON
(looking at Mance)
I was this man’s prisoner once. He
could have tortured me. He could
have killed me. But he spared my
life.
(beat)
I think my father would have taken
him prisoner, and listened to what
he had to say.
Stannis weighs this advice.
STANNIS
Very well, then. Ser Davos -- take
him.
Davos leads Mance Rayder to Stannis’ honor guard. Stannis
turns to walk away.
JON
Your Grace.
Stannis turns back.
JON
If my father had seen the things
I’ve seen, he’d also tell you to
burn the dead before nightfall. All
of them.
INT. LABORATORY (PYCELLE'S ROOM) - DAY
An equally horrible sight: THE MOUNTAIN, lying on a massive
table. As we move along his leg, we see the gruesome rot
creeping around his knee, from the place where Oberyn’s
poisoned spear hamstrung him.
We hear his shallow, irregular breaths, the death rattle
sound -- and when we get to the wound in his midsection, it
is far worse, festering and blackening. The one beneath his
arm doesn’t look so hot, either.
And we keep moving onto QYBURN’s face, inches from the wound,
examining it, fixated upon it.
GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE and CERSEI LANNISTER both hold scented
handkerchiefs to their noses. Qyburn does not, even though he
is much closer to the body.
Cersei is not pleased. Her champion is dying.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 11
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
PYCELLE
I would suggest milk of the poppy
to ease his pain, but he is
completely insensate.
Timidly, Pycelle pokes the Mountain’s body with a long, thin
metal prod. Nothing.
CERSEI
Bloody Martells.
PYCELLE
The cause appears to be manticore
venom.
QYBURN
It is. The Death’s Head manticore.
Pycelle is mildly annoyed that the man would deign to speak,
even though Qyburn is agreeing with him.
PYCELLE
I’ve read a great deal about it. A
horrible poison, usually Mantari in
origin. Once it enters the
bloodstream...
Pycelle pokes the wound with his prod.
PYCELLE
Mm. Nothing to be done.
QYBURN
Yes there is.
This is Qyburn’s passion; we see as much on his face. He does
not ask for permission before leaping into action,
commandeering paraphernalia from Pycelle’s lab, setting it up
around the Mountain’s body: jars, oddly shaped herbs, vials
of colored liquids.
PYCELLE
May I ask what you think you’re
doing?
QYBURN
Saving him.
PYCELLE
Your Grace... I wish it were
otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond
saving. Well beyond. And this, this
man is not even a Maester, let
alone Grand Maester--
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 12
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
QYBURN
That’s for the best. No Maester
knows how to save him.
Qyburn lays out his personal collection of dubious medical
devices on a table and begins to pick out the ones he needs.
 PYCELLE
That is exactly the sort of
arrogance that got him expelled
from the Citadel, Your Grace.
But Cersei isn’t listening to him. She’s watching Qyburn
drawing fluids from the Mountain's body: inserting a thick
needle into his arm so his thickening, diseased blood can
trickle out of his body and into a draining pan on the floor.
PYCELLE
His curiosity was deemed dangerous
and unnatural, and rightly so, in
my opinion.
CERSEI
You’re dismissed, Grand Maester.
PYCELLE
But-- but, Your Grace, this is my
laboratory.
CERSEI
Not anymore.
Pycelle prepares to speak, but Cersei’s expression tells him
this would be a horrible idea.
Exit Pycelle.
Cersei addresses Qyburn.
CERSEI
You can save him?
QYBURN
Difficult to say, Your Grace.
(beat)
But if my past work is any guide,
we stand a chance.
As the Mountain’s bodily fluids continue to drain into the
pan on the floor, Qyburn prepares to replace them with a
large medieval syringe.
CERSEI
Do everything you can. Come to me
for anything you need.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 13
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
QYBURN
Thank you, Your Grace.
Qyburn fills the syringe from a jar of evil, viscous liquid.
QYBURN
You should know that the process
may... change him. Somewhat.
CERSEI
Will it weaken him?
QYBURN
(very much the contrary)
Oh no.
CERSEI
Very well, then.
Exit Cersei, as Qyburn slides the tip of the syringe into the
Mountain’s festering wound.
INT. CHAMBER OF THE HAND - DAY
Cersei sits before TYWIN LANNISTER at his desk.
TYWIN
Not another word. We’ve been over
this. The matter is closed.
CERSEI
I’m opening it again.
TYWIN
You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell,
you are still betrothed to Loras
Tyrell, and you will marry him as
soon as Tommen is married to
Margaery.
CERSEI
I will not.
TYWIN
Jaime cannot marry or inherit
lands. Tyrion’s sentence will be
carried out tomorrow. You have, on
several occasions, made great
claims about your commitment to
this family’s future. Your role in
that future is more vital now than
it ever was.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 14
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
CERSEI
I don’t care. I will stay in King’s
Landing where I belong. With my
son. The King.
Tywin thinks about this ultimatum for a moment.
TYWIN
When you were nine years old, I was
called to the capital. I decided to
take your brother with me, but not
you. Do you remember? You insisted
you would not be left behind at
Casterly Rock, under any
circumstances. And if you recall--
CERSEI
I’m not interested in hearing
another one of your smug stories
about the time you won. This isn’t
going to be one of those times.
Tywin stares at his daughter. She stares back.
TYWIN
Do you think you’ll be the first
person dragged into a Sept and
married against their will?
Cersei came here knowing that this would be her last chance
to avoid an awful fate. She came prepared to go all-in. Now
she does.
CERSEI
When you marched into the throne
room to tell me we’d won the Battle
of Blackwater... do you remember? I
was sitting on the Iron Throne with
Tommen. I was about to give him
essence of nightshade. That’s how
far I was willing to go when I
thought someone awful had come to
take my son away.
(re: Tywin himself)
Someone awful is coming to take him
away. Joffrey’s dead, Myrcella’s
been sold off like livestock, and
now you want to ship me to
Highgarden and steal my boy. My
last boy. You’ll dig your claws in,
and Margaery will dig her claws in,
and you’ll fight over him like
beasts until you rip him apart.
(beat)
I will burn our House to the ground
before I let that happen.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 15
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
TYWIN
And how will you do that?
CERSEI
I’ll tell everyone the truth.
TYWIN
Which truth would that be?
She scrutinizes her father for a long while, until she
realizes it for certain:
CERSEI
You don’t know, do you?
(beat)
You never believed it. How is that
possible?
In what may be the most tense moment of her very tense life
with her father, she cannot suppress a laugh.
CERSEI
What am I saying, of course it’s
possible. How could someone so
consumed by the idea of his family
have any conception what his actual
family was doing?
(beat)
We were right there in front of you
and you didn’t see us. One look in
the past twenty years, one real
look at your own children and you
would have known.
(beat)
Everything they say is true, about
Jaime and me. Your legacy is a lie.
Silence.
TYWIN
I don’t believe you.
She examines his face.
CERSEI
Yes you do.
Cersei turns her back on her father and walks away.
INT. KINGSGUARD CHAMBER - DAY
JAIME LANNISTER looks at his page in the Kingsguard’s white
book, his name prominently featured at the top.
CERSEI

Jaime looks to see her in the doorway, then looks away.
JAIME
You won. One fewer brother. You
must be proud of yourself.
She enters the room, closes the door behind her.
JAIME
There’s really nothing you wouldn’t
do, is there?
She is flush with power off the previous scene. She steps
toward him and answers without hesitation:
CERSEI
For my family? No. Nothing. I would
do things for my family that you
couldn’t imagine.
JAIME
Tyrion is your family.
CERSEI
He is not.
JAIME
You don’t get to choose.
CERSEI
I do. So do you. You can choose the
creature that killed our mother to
come into this world--
JAIME
Are you really mad enough to blame
him for that? He didn’t decide to
kill her, he was an infant--
CERSEI
A disease doesn’t decide to kill
you. All the same, you cut it out
before it does.
She moves in closer still.
CERSEI
So what do you decide? What do you
choose?
She is asking him to make the most difficult choice of his
life. Her recent behavior has made it more difficult still.
JAIME
The things I did to get back to
you... to endure all that, and
return to find you--
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 17
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
She cuts him off by pressing her mouth to his.
CERSEI
I choose you.
JAIME
Those are words.
CERSEI
Yes. Just like the ones I said to
father.
(beat)
I told him.
JAIME
Told him what?
CERSEI
I told him about us.
Jaime has always been the one pushing to bring their
relationship out into the open, but he is dumbstruck.
JAIME
You told him--
CERSEI
I told him I won’t marry Loras
Tyrell. I told him I’m staying
right here, with Tommen, with you.
JAIME
And you think he’ll just accept
that?
CERSEI
Go ask him.
Jaime knows his sister better than anyone in the world. He
doesn’t know how she did it, but he can see that, somehow,
she has brought their father to heel.
JAIME
What did you say?
CERSEI
I don’t want to talk about Tywin
Lannister. I don’t choose Tywin
Lannister, I don’t love Tywin
Lannister. I love my brother, I
love my lover.
She kisses Jaime again.
CERSEI
People will whisper, they’ll make
their jokes... let them.

They’re all so small I can’t even

She kisses him again until they’re both breathless. She pulls
away and starts to unbutton his shirt.
JAIME
Someone will walk in.
She takes his golden hand in her hands.
CERSEI
I don’t care.
She kisses his golden fingers.
He grabs the hair at the back of her head and kisses her, the
way he kissed her at Casterly Rock twenty years ago. He
swings her around and lays her out on the Kingsguard table.
INT. GREAT PYRAMID - AUDIENCE HALL - DAY
DAENERYS TARGARYEN sits on her bench at the top of the steps.
She looks tired. She hasn’t slept much in the past few
nights. GREY WORM and SER BARRISTAN SELMY stand at ease on

Together, the two men help Fennesz up the stairs.
As he nears the top, Grey Worm has a slight smile for
Missandei. Missandei smiles back until she sees Dany
noticing, at which point she suppresses it.
FENNESZ

(Thank you for seeing me, Your
Grace. My name is Fennesz.)
(in perfect English)
I can speak the Common Tongue, if
you wish.
DANY
You speak it very well.
FENNESZ
Before you freed me, I belonged to
Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his
children, I taught them languages
and history. They know a great deal
about your family because of me.
Little Calla is only seven, but she
admires you very much.
DANY
I hope I prove worthy of her
admiration. What can I do for you?
FENNESZ
When you took the city, the
children begged me not to leave the
house, but Master Migdhal and I
agreed that I must. So I lost my
home. Now I live on the streets.
DANY
I’ve outfitted mess halls to feed
all former slaves, and barracks to
shelter them.
FENNESZ
I do not mean to offend, Your
Grace, but these places... I went
to one, for three nights. The young
prey on the old, take what they
want and beat us if we resist. I’d
rather take my chances on the
street.
Dany’s anger upon hearing this is plain.

DANY
My Unsullied will make them safe in
short order, my friend. This I

FENNESZ
Even if they are safe, who would I
be there? What purpose would I
serve? With my Master I was a
teacher, I had the respect and love
of his children.
DANY
What is it that you want from me?
FENNESZ
Your Grace, I ask that you let me
sell myself back to Master Mighdal.
The request shocks Dany into silence for a moment.
DANY
You want to return to a man who
owned you, like a goat or a chair?
FENNESZ
Please, Your Grace. The young may
rejoice in the new world you have
built for them, but for those of us
too old to change, there is only
fear and squalor.
He looks back to the chamber door.
FENNESZ
I am not alone. There are many
outside, waiting to beg the same of
you.
Dany faces a serious conundrum.
DANY
I did not take this city to preside
over the injustice I’ve fought to
destroy. I took it to bring people
freedom.
(beat)
But freedom means making your own
choices. I will allow you to sign a
contract with your former master.
It may not cover a period longer
than a year.
FENNESZ
Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you.

Satisfied, the man heads back down the stairs with Grey
Worm’s help.
BARRISTAN
The Masters will take advantage of
this situation. The men serving
them will be slaves in all but
name.
Dany’s silence acknowledges the ugly fact that there are no
easy choices in this situation.
She’s not happy about it, but she doesn’t know what else to
do for the moment, and a new supplicant is entering her
chamber: a GOATHERD, with a bundle in his arms.
Dany notes the state of this man: his eyes are bloodshot and
dead, his bundle trembles in his arms.
DANY
Approach, my friend.
The man looks at her, uncomprehending.
GOATHERD
(in low Valyrian)
Tha shifang, nya Thal.
(I do not understand, my Queen.)
Dany does not understand his guttural speech: Low Valyrian
again. She looks to Missandei.
MISSANDEI
Ye Thal poghash koth nyesha.
(The Queen says you may approach.)
The man climbs the stairs with his bundle. He is an empty
shell. He looks like the wind would blow him away. He speaks,
and Missandei translates:
GOATHERD

Missandei is confused by what she’s translating, but Dany is
not. She is already looking with foreboding at the bundle in
the man’s arms.

Bones, small bones, charred on the ends. And a little skull.
A child’s remains. It is all Missandei can do to translate.

Dany stares at the horror before her.

Dany sits, toying with one of the necklaces Drogo gave her
long ago.
Missandei stands nearby, and Grey Worm not far away.
DANY
What was her name?
Missandei hesitates, until Dany looks up at her.
MISSANDEI
Zala, your Grace.
DANY
How old was she?

There is something heartbreaking about the number three, in

Finally she stands and heads for the door, issuing a command
to Grey Worm:
DANY

(Meet me at the catacombs.)
Grey Worm nods. Missandei glances at him, worried. He stares
back at her, impassive.
INT. CATACOMBS- DAY
Two roasted goats’ carcasses have been left for the dragons
in the center of the cavernous chamber. The hungry beasts
descend, tearing the goats to pieces and devouring them.
Dany’s babies have grown into powerful monsters. But they’re
still her babies. She crouches by them, stroking their long
necks as they eat, whispering quiet words to soothe them.
They don't notice the massive collars and chains on the
floor, chains normally used to anchor ships.
Dany snaps one collar in place around Viserion’s neck, then
the other around Rhaegal’s, whispering soothing words the
whole time. They're too hungry to notice much or care.
They don't realize their mother is crying.
Dany walks away from them. At the double doors she turns and
looks back at her dragons.
Now the dragons realize something is wrong. They try to shuck
out of their collars but can’t. They cry to her for help.
EXT. CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD - DAY
The castle is crowded with BARATHEON TROOPS wearing the
Flaming Heart sigil.
But the courtyard is given over now to the brothers of the
Night’s Watch. The bodies of all the dead brothers who died
in the battle have been piled onto a tiered funeral pyre.

AEMON
And now their watch is ended.
SAMWELL TARLY hands a torch to MAESTER AEMON and guides the
old man to the pyre, helping him to light the first kindling.
Aemon hands the torch to Sam, who lights more kindling.
Sam hands the torch to Jon, and Jon to Edd, and so on, a
communal lighting of the pyre.
Only JANOS SLYNT refuses the torch, when Edd offers it to
him. Edd hands the torch to OLLY, the next man (boy) in line.
Jon looks up and sees Stannis and Davos standing on the
walkway where Lord Commander Mormont used to watch the
recruits.
SELYSE BARATHEON is here too, watching the ritual with grim
fascination. SHIREEN BARATHEON sits by herself on the landing
by the mess hall, her feet dangling over the edge. There is
something incongruous about a child in Castle Black.
Jon Snow turns his gaze back to the funeral pyre, watching
the flames devour his friends.
He looks up and sees someone through the flames staring right
back at him. A beautiful woman dressed all in red, completely
out of place in the black and white world of Castle Black.
MELISANDRE watches Jon curiously: she sees something
interesting in this young man. It’s impossible to tell if her
smile is admiring or mocking.
INT. CASTLE BLACK - CELL - DAY
Lacking proper cells, the brothers have turned this room into
a makeshift holding cell for TORMUND and two other WILDLING
captives (no Thenns, Thenns don’t get captured alive), who
sit on the floor.

Tormund’s wounds have been bandaged.
The prisoners are all shackled, hands tied behind their
backs. Unlike virtually everyone else in Westeros, the
Night’s Watch knows how to keep prisoners imprisoned.
Jon approaches. Tormund glares up at him.
TORMUND
Your old blind man patched me up.
(off Jon’s nod)
Why?
JON
He’s sworn to treat all wounded
men. Friend or foe.
This is an alien concept to Tormund. There must be a logical
explanation.
TORMUND
You want me alive so you can
torture me?
JON
No one’s going to torture you.
TORMUND
So how do we die? Hanging?
Beheading? Drop us from the top of
the Wall?
JON
I don’t know what happens with the
prisoners.
TORMUND
Who decides?
JON
I suppose Stannis does.
TORMUND

JON

TORMUND

JON
Say farewell.
Tormund glances at his wildling comrades. All of them stare
up at Jon. What the fuck is he talking about?
TORMUND
The dead can’t hear us, boy.
Jon nods. He begins to walk away.
TORMUND
Snow.

Did you love her?
Jon hesitates and then nods.
TORMUND
She loved you.
JON
She told you?
TORMUND
No! All she ever talked about was
killing you. That’s how I know.
Tormund smiles, but he’s not mocking Jon.
TORMUND
She belongs in the North. The real
North. You understand me?
EXT. NORTH OF THE WALL - DAY
A horse is tied to a tree. A sledge is harnessed to the
horse.
Not far from the weirwood tree where he said his vows, Jon
Snow finishes building a small funeral pyre for YGRITTE.

She lies near the top, pale and tiny without her heavy
leather outfit (i.e., wearing light top and trousers).
He kneels beside the pyre and strikes a flint, sparking the
kindling.
He stands back from the flames and stares at her cold little
freckled face.
He closes his eyes. He doesn’t want to watch her burn.
The smoke rises above them, above the weirwood tree and its
canopy of red leaves, higher and higher into the cold blue
sky.
EXT. NORTH OF THE WALL - DAY
Two pairs of ragged feet trudge up a snowy incline, very
close together. One of them is having trouble walking: JOJEN
REED.
MEERA REED props him up, his arm over her shoulder, and helps
him onward. Jojen is in awful shape, pale, sweating despite
the frigid cold, half-delirious.
MEERA
We can stop. We can rest.
JOJEN
Rest with the Three-Eyed Raven.
Ahead of them, HODOR pulls BRAN STARK forward on his sled, as
SUMMER struggles to keep up. Facing Jojen, Bran is worried.
Jojen only smiles.
As Hodor and Bran crest the hill, Jojen stumbles and falls.
Meera kneels beside him.
MEERA
We’re not going to make it.
JOJEN
We’re already here.
BRAN (O.S.)
Jojen! Look!
Meera helps Jojen to his feet, and together they take the
last few steps to join Bran at the hilltop, and see what he
sees:
The distinctive four-peaked hill from Bran’s visions rises up
before them, on the other side of a snowy plain. Two huge and
ancient weirwoods flank a cleft in the rock ahead, trunks
like turret towers, their red leaves bathing a large swath of
the foothills in shadow.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 28
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
They look upon it with awe. This is the reason they’ve all
come together and made this impossible journey. This is their
destination.
No words are spoken. None are needed. Bran looks to Jojen,
who manages a weak smile. Together, they head down the hill,
toward the twin weirwoods.
Dwarfed by the epic landscape, they cover the final stretch
of ground.
The snow is deeper here; Summer is having trouble with it.
We see the weary determination in their faces. Bran
struggling to stay on his sled. The grip of Hodor’s frozen
hands on its handles.
Jojen is swooning, unsteady on his feet. He has to stop.
Bran calls out:
BRAN
Are you alright?
Meera looks at him: are you? Can you make it?
Panting, Jojen nods, and calls upon his last reserves to make
the final push.
He lifts his foot off the snowy ground.
And a skeletal hand bursts from the snow next to it and grabs
his ankle.
Meera struggles to free her brother from the hand’s grasp.
Bran shouts at Hodor:
BRAN
Help them! Now!
Hodor lets go of the sled and runs to Jojen and Meera -- but
another skeletal hand shoots from the snow to block his way,
terrifying the poor giant. He kicks it away.
HODOR
Hodor Hodor Hodor...
Summer steps in next to Bran, growling, on full alert.
Meera manages to free her brother from the creature’s grip,
but the force of her efforts pull them both backwards into
the snow.
And that is where they lie when the WIGHT claws its way out
from its resting place.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 29
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
The wights we have seen until now have been recently turned;
this one is very, very old. Little of its rotten flesh
remains on its bones. A few scraps of leather hang from its
frame. It is armed with the rusty sword with which it was
buried -- a weapon from a different epoch, possibly thousands
of years old.
The creature rises to its feet and comes for Jojen and Meera.
Another WIGHT emerges behind them.
TWO MORE WIGHTS dig their way out of the snow, blocking
Hodor’s way, throwing themselves at him. Hodor stops
“Hodor”ing, and starts screaming, desperately trying to shake
the creatures off.
Bran sees Hodor panicking, and Meera brandishing her dagger.
BRAN
Hodor, stop! Help them!
But Hodor is not helping them. He’s terrified, flailing --
not even noticing that a WIGHT is using the foot of Bran’s
sled to pull itself into the open air, crawling along his
useless legs to get at his throat.
Summer grabs the creature by the neck, hauls it away and
shakes it violently until its head rolls off. Its skeletal
jaws keep clacking; its headless body keeps moving.
The first wight swings at Meera. She ducks the swing and
buries her blade between the wight’s ribs, to no effect. The
thing keeps coming.
Hodor is cowering, useless as the wights close in on him.
Bran steels himself, takes a deep breath, and his eyes go
warg white.
Hodor’s eyes flicker. Bran is inside Hodor now. And Bran is
angry.
Hodor lurches to his feet and hurls the encroaching wights
away like rag-dolls. He fights his way to Jojen and Meera
with the ferocity of an angry bear, driving his massive fists
into the wight's skulls, ripping arms out of sockets.
When Hodor reaches Jojen and Meera, however, Jojen sees the
situation:
THREE WIGHTS are emerging from the snow behind Bran.
FOUR MORE WIGHTS are popping up between Jojen and Bran.
Another FOUR WIGHTS are clawing their way from beneath the
snow behind Jojen.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 30
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
Jojen knows Bran is controlling Hodor; he looks into Hodor’s
eyes, and speaks directly to Bran. [Note: the closeups of
Jojen here should be done in Bran’s warging POV.]
JOJEN
Save yourself.
Bran himself is impassive, white eyes betraying nothing.
But we read Bran’s horror at this suggestion in Hodor’s face.
Hodor moves his mouth to speak, but speaking through Hodor is
something Bran cannot yet do.
JOJEN
Now!
Hodor turns away and heads back to protect Bran.
Meera prepares to fight the incoming wights to the best of
her ability.
Hodor thrashes his way back through the wights that have
popped up between Jojen and Bran.
Meera fights off two wights that are coming for Jojen-- she
does a good job, disarming one of them and using its sword to
hack them both up.
But she doesn’t see the wight scrambling across the ground
for Jojen. She only becomes aware of it when the creature
buries its long knife in Jojen’s belly, and Jojen screams.
The wights behind Bran are closing on him. Hodor isn’t going
to get to Bran in time to save him/himself.
Meera gets to Jojen, pulls the wight off him and beheads it
in a single stroke. She crouches beside her brother, whose
blood is staining the snow red in a widening circle.
MEERA
No. No no no no...
And still more of them are coming for Jojen.
And Bran: the wights behind him are almost upon him, nearer
than Hodor. Stuck in Hodor’s body, Bran is about to watch
himself die in Hodor’s POV.
We’re on an insensate, white-eyed Bran (not in Hodor’s POV)
when the two wights behind him go up in flames.
Bran/Hodor sees this, and wargs back to Bran.
Bran’s irises return, and he turns to see the burning wights
fall, revealing a CHILD OF THE FOREST.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 31

(CONTINUED)
At first glance, she appears to be a small girl. At second
glance, it becomes clear she is not human. Her sharp bone
structure, her slightly elongated proportions, her dappled
skin, her impossibly wide set eyes.
In her hand: a small clay globe. She throws it at an emerging
wight and the creature bursts into flames, covered in magical
napalm.
Her voice is not that of a child and not that of an adult:
CHILD OF THE FOREST
Come with me, Brandon Stark. There
are more. There are always more.
Jojen sees the Child of the Forest, and the wights that are
closing on him and Meera. Meera tries to move him.
Impossible.
She screams to Bran and Hodor and the Child.
MEERA
Help me! Help me!
CHILD OF THE FOREST
He’s lost. Come with me or die with
him.
The Child is neither afraid nor mournful. Her task here is
saving Brandon Stark. Everyone else is irrelevant.
Meera looks down to her dying brother, unwilling to let him
go. But Jojen nods at her: do it. Live for both of us.
Crying, Meera knows it’s true. He stares into her eyes and
nods once, slowly.
She kisses her brother on the forehead. And beneath the
frame, she cuts his throat.
She flees toward Bran, Hodor and Summer, following the Child
of the Forest up the incline, to the mouth of the cave
between the two weirwoods. The wights pursue them.
They can only move so fast with Bran on his sled. And the
wights are gaining.
The Child of the Forest’s last act before entering the cave:
she throws a clay globe at Jojen’s body, lighting it up,
robbing the White Walkers of one more piece of grist for
their mill.
They enter the cave.

A wight tries to follow them, but the moment it crosses the
threshold, the force that animates and holds it together
ceases to work. The skeleton collapses, bones clattering on
the ground.
INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS
Bran sees this happen. As he pulls around the corner of the
cave tunnel, another wight follows and suffers the same fate.
Bran, Hodor, Meera and Summer follow the Child of the Forest
down through the low twisty tunnel. Weirwood roots slither in
and out of the earthen walls like white snakes.
Meera is shattered. Jojen is dead. Her reason for being has
been taken away.
The tunnel is difficult for Hodor to maneuver, and the
weirwood roots freak him out.
BRAN
Hurry, Hodor.
CHILD OF THE FOREST
They cannot follow us here. The
power that moves them is powerless
here.
The weirwood roots grow thicker as they go.
BRAN
Who are you?
CHILD OF THE FOREST
The First Men called us the
Children. We were born long before
them.

Come. He waits for you.
The passage eventually opens up into a huge cavern, barely
lit by thin shafts of light breaking through the root
ceiling.
As they proceed, the floor beneath them is littered with
bones. Ravens perch here and there, hopping from skull to
skull, staring at the newcomers.
Looking to one side, Bran sees that the cave network extends
far beyond this chamber, lit with similar shafts of light.
And in the distance, figures move into and out of those
shafts of light: other Children of the Forest, glimpsing at
the newcomers before disappearing into the darkness.
They move toward a thick pillar of twisted roots, visible to
them only in silhouette.

The Child of the Forest drops one of her clay globes in a
rough brazier of black volcanic rock near the base of the
root structure, revealing:
The THREE-EYED RAVEN.
A pale man in tattered black clothes sits in a tangled nest
of roots -- a woven weirwood throne that wraps around his
limbs. The roots have grown over him, under him, and through
him, burrowed through his limbs and come out the other side.
His hair is white and filament-thin, his skin pale white and
stretch taut across his face like leather. The only part of
him that really seems alive is his eyes.

You’re the Three-Eyed Raven.

POD
I hobbled them last night.
Pod searches for a horse that might be hiding under a rock
while Brienne stares at him.
BRIENNE
What sort of hobble?
Pod knows he’s in serious trouble. He’s not giving up the
search, even though there’s no possible place for a horse to
be hiding.

ARYA STARK stands in the middle of the road practicing her
fighting moves.
Her pony and the Hound’s horse, Stranger, are tied up not far
away.
Unlike the last time we saw Arya (when the Hound mocked her),
her swordplay now is less theatrical. Fewer flourishes and
spins, more deadly thrusts.
She stops when she hears footsteps coming from down the road.
She keeps her voice low as she calls to the Hound, who isn’t
visible from here.
ARYA
People coming.

You can shit later, there’s people
coming.
Brienne emerges around a bend in the road, followed a few
seconds later by Pod, who has sweat clean through his clothes
as he trudges forward under the weight of the saddle bags.
Arya waits for them in the middle of the road, Needle in
hand. She looks ready for a fight.
But when she realizes that Brienne is a woman her expression
changes. She’s never seen a woman in armor before.
Brienne nods as she approaches.

This comment has the exact opposite effect on Arya than
Brienne might have expected. Arya’s face hardens.
ARYA
My mother’s dead.
BRIENNE
I know. I wish I’d been there to
protect her.
ARYA
You’re not a northerner.
Brienne is not very good at soothing troubled young girls.
She tries to convince Arya by simply telling the truth, but
the truth is not very convincing.

BRIENNE
No. But I swore sacred vow to
protect your mother--
ARYA
Why didn’t you?
Brienne hesitates. She knows this won’t sound good to Arya.
BRIENNE
She commanded me to bring Jaime
Lannister back to King’s Landing.
HOUND
You’re paid by the Lannisters? You
here for the bounty on me?
BRIENNE
I am not paid by the Lannisters.
HOUND
No? Fancy sword you got there.
Where’d you get it?
(off Brienne’s silence)
I been looking at Lannister gold
all my life. Go on, Brienne of
fucking Tarth. Tell me that’s not
Lannister gold.
Arya waits for an answer from Brienne. Finally:
BRIENNE
Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
Arya steps to the side of the road, clearing space for
Brienne.
ARYA
The Bloody Gate’s ten miles.
BRIENNE
I swore to your mother, by the old
gods --
ARYA
I don’t care what you swore.
BRIENNE
Arya--
HOUND
You heard the girl. She’s not
coming with you.
BRIENNE
She is.

The Hound draws his sword eight inches clear of its scabbard.
HOUND
You’re not a good listener.
Brienne draws her sword eight inches clear of its scabbard.
The Hound is impressed.
HOUND
That Valyrian steel? I always
wanted some Valyrian steel.
BRIENNE
Come with me, Arya. I’ll take you
to safety.
HOUND
Safety? Where the fuck’s that? Her
aunt in the Eyrie is dead. Her
mother’s dead. Her father’s dead.
Her brother’s dead. Winterfell’s a
pile of rubble. There is no safety,
you dumb bitch. You don’t know that
by now, you’re the wrong one to
watch over her.
BRIENNE
And that’s what you’re doing?
Watching over her?
HOUND
Aye. That’s what I’m doing.
He draws his sword clean of the scabbard. Brienne draws hers.
Pod backs away. So does Arya.
The Hound charges and swings. Brienne is immediately on the
defensive. As good as she is, she’s never fought anyone as
strong or ferocious as Sandor Clegane.
Again and again the Hound hacks at her and Brienne is barely
able to fend him off.
Arya watches, not entirely sure who she’s rooting for.
Pod watches, fairly sure he’s going to be unemployed soon.
Several times in the opening seconds of the fight it looks as
if the Hound might be able to score a quick kill.
But Brienne holds him off and the Hound, already weakened
from his infected wounds, soon begins to tire.
Before long Brienne is able to match him blow for blow.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 40
CONTINUED: (4)
(CONTINUED)
The Hound is panting now, sweating despite the cold, his hair
plastered down over his burnt face, taking deep breaths.
[At some point during this fight Arya should no longer be
visible, but we should not see her slip away.]
Brienne knows if she can keep the fight going a little longer
she’ll wear her opponent down and defeat him. She’s content
to fight conservatively and let him make the first mistake.
The Hound knows he doesn’t have much time left. He launches a
desperate final attack, raining blows down on the cool and
composed Brienne, who blocks every one.
On the final parry Brienne slashes the Hound’s right wrist
and he drops his sword.
She levels the point of her sword at his heart.
BRIENNE
I have no wish to kill you, ser.
HOUND
I’m not a knight.
He grabs her sword in his gloved hands and holds on tight,
though the blade bites into his palms and blood begins to
flow, for long enough to bash her in the throat with his
forearm and grab her in a bear hug.
Even sick and exhausted he’s still far stronger than she is.
She’s unable to lift her sword arm.
He slams his forehead into her nose and now Brienne’s
bleeding and dazed.
He tries for another headbutt to finish her off but Brienne
jerks her head to the side so he doesn’t land. She bites down
hard on his ear.
The Hound snarls and Brienne bites and finally spits out a
wad of bloody ear.
The Hound manages to wrestle her to the ground, her sword
falling away, and they grapple on the rocks, punching and
kicking at each other, tumbling closer to a steep cliff.
The Hound manages to pull his dagger. Before he can cut her
with it, Brienne grabs a rock and clocks the Hound in the
side of the head.
The Hound topples over, bleeding quite a bit now. But the
Hound won’t quit until he’s dead. He staggers to his feet and
charges at her again.
Brienne sidesteps and smashes him again in the side of the
head with the rock.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 41

(CONTINUED)
The Hound falls to his knees. Brienne kicks him in the face,
hard.
The Hound falls over the edge of the ravine, tumbling down
the steep rocky face and lying still at the base of the
ravine.
Brienne stands on the edge of the ravine and looks down at
him. He’s not moving.
She gathers up her sword and turns for Arya.
But Arya’s not here anymore.
BRIENNE
Where is she?
Pod, stunned by the fight he’s just seen, looks around.
POD
She was just here!
BRIENNE
Why weren’t you watching her?
POD
I was watching you, I... I thought
you might need help.
BRIENNE
Which way, Pod! Which way did she
go?
POD
I... I think that way.
Brienne, bloodied and furious, marches in that direction.
BRIENNE
Arya! ARYA!
Pod picks up the saddle bags and chases after her.
But Arya hasn’t gone down the road, or up the road. She has
scrambled to the top of a rock formation above the road.
We find her up there now, waiting until Brienne and Pod are
safely out of sight.
Then she scrambles down the rocky face and into the ravine.
EXT. RAVINE - DAY
Arya approaches the Hound.
He’s still breathing but he doesn’t look good.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 42
CONTINUED: (6)
(CONTINUED)
One of his legs is broken, the pale bone peeking through his
torn pants.
His eyes are closed, his face battered and his breathing
uneven.
Arya knows how dangerous wounded dogs can be. She approaches
carefully, not getting too close, her hand on Needle’s hilt.
He opens his eyes when he hears her.
HOUND
You’re still here?
He coughs. Flecks of blood come up with his sputum. He sees
the blood. He knows what it means.
HOUND
Big bitch saved you.
ARYA
Don’t need saving.
HOUND
No, not you. You’re a real killer.
With your water dancing. And your
Needle.
ARYA
You gonna die?
HOUND
Unless there’s a maester hiding
behind that rock. Aye, I’m done.
(coughs again)
I’d skin you alive for wine.
She offers him a water skin.
HOUND
Fuck water.
He shifts slightly, trying to find a less painful position.
But there is no less painful position.
HOUND
Killed by a woman. Bet you like
that. Go on, go after her, she’ll
help you.
Arya gives a slow shake of her head.
HOUND
Going it alone? You won’t last a
day out there.
Arya stares at him, cold and pitiless.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 43
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
ARYA
I’ll last longer than you.
The Hound grins, his teeth wet with blood. He can't argue
with that.
HOUND
You remember where the heart is?
She nods.
The Hound takes a deep breath and looks into the sky. There
are no meaningful birds. There’s nothing to look at but rocks
and sky and Arya Stark.
HOUND
Fuck it all. I’m ready.
Arya doesn’t move. The Hound mistakes her motionlessness for
timidity.
HOUND
Go on, girl. Another name off your
list. You kept promising me.
Arya still doesn’t move. The Hound sees that he’ll need to
provoke her to murder.
HOUND
I cut down that butcher’s boy of
yours, the ginger. He was begging
for mercy. “Please, ser, please
don’t kill me, please, please.”
Bled all over my horse. Saddle
stunk of butcher boy for weeks.
Arya watches him, silent.
HOUND
And your sister... your pretty
sister... I should have taken her.
That night the Blackwater burned. I
should have fucked her bloody. At
least I'd have one happy memory.
But Arya will not be provoked. She stares down at the Hound
as he grimaces, the pain becoming overwhelming, the sweat
dripping down his face.
HOUND
You want me to beg you? Do it.
At last Arya crouches down beside him. We think she’s finally
going to kill him but instead she takes his coin purse [the
same one the Hound stole from Mortimer the Farmer in 403.]
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 44
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
When the Hound realizes what she’s doing he grabs for her,
but she’s too quick for him in his weakened state.
She rises and walks away, clambering up the ravine. The Hound
screams after her.
HOUND
Kill me! Kill me! KILL ME!
Arya walks toward her horse, her face emotionless as the
Hound screams, never looking back.
INT. TYRION’S CELL - NIGHT
TYRION LANNISTER lies on the pallet on the floor, his cell
lit only by weak moonlight leaking in through the barred
window.
He stares at the ceiling. It has been a long and sleepless
night.
He hears footsteps approaching and sees torchlight under the
door. He stands and steels himself for the last minutes of
his life.
The key rattles in the lock and the door creaks inward.
Tyrion raises a hand to shield his eyes from the light.
TYRION
Get on with it, you son of a whore.
JAIME
Is that any way to speak about our
mother?
Tyrion stares at Jaime, standing silhouetted in the doorway.
The torch rests in a bracket in the hallway behind him.
TYRION
What are you doing?
Jaime swings the key chain around his finger.
JAIME
What do you think I’m doing?
INT. CORRIDOR BY TYRION’S CELL - - NIGHT
Jaime leads Tyrion out of the cell.
JAIME
A galley’s waiting in the bay,
bound for the Free Cities.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 45
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
They step around two unconscious GUARDS lying on the floor.
TYRION
Who’s helping you?
JAIME
Varys.
The last time Tyrion saw Varys the eunuch was betraying him
during the trial.
TYRION
Varys?
JAIME
You have more friends than you
thought.
INT. TUNNELS BENEATH THE RED KEEP - NIGHT
They reach a stairway leading upwards. Jaime stops here and
fixes the torch in a sconce.
JAIME
(re: staircase)
There’s a locked door at the top of
the stairs. Knock on it twice, then
twice again. Varys will open.
Tyrion nods. Neither man knows what to say to the other.
TYRION
I suppose this is goodbye, then.
Jaime goes to one knee and kisses Tyrion on each cheek.
The unexpected tenderness startles Tyrion.
JAIME
Farewell, little brother.
Jaime stands and starts to go.
TYRION
Jaime.
Jaime turns.
TYRION
Thank you. For my life.
Jaime smiles and gestures to the stairs.
JAIME
Quickly now.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 46
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Jaime walks away, disappearing into the darkness.
Tyrion watches him go. He doesn’t expect to ever see his
older brother again.
When Jaime is gone, Tyrion looks up the stairs. Escape lies
that way. Life and freedom.
But he has other business to deal with first.
INT. TYWIN LANNISTER’S OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT
Tyrion emerges from a cleverly hidden trapdoor in Tywin’s
complex atop the Tower of the Hand.
He walks past the Small Council table, where Tywin shamed him
many times. Past the desk, where Tywin shamed him many times.
INT. TYWIN’S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
A dark-haired woman lies atop the bedclothes, her face turned
away from us, naked save for the golden chains she wears
round her neck.
On a wood board atop the bedside table there’s a halved
apple, cheese, and a small, sharp knife.
Staring at the naked woman, not really believing who she is,
Tyrion walks quietly toward the bed.
Not quietly enough.
SHAE
Tywin? My lion?
She turns with a smile on her face. The smile disappears when
she sees Tyrion.
For a long beat they stare at each other, neither one
believing what they’re seeing.
Then everything moves very quickly.
SHAE reaches for the little blade on the bedside table.
Tyrion lunges forward, getting on top of her and grabbing for
her wrist as she swings at his face.
She cuts his hand and swings again but he manages to catch
her wrist on the second swing.
She claws at him with her free hand, ferocious, all the love
she once had for him now turned to hatred for the man who
betrayed her.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 47
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Tyrion twists her knife hand and Shae gasps, dropping the
knife.
She grabs for his face, trying to claw his eyes out.
Tyrion gets hold of the gold chains she wears as a necklace.
The gift he gave her not so long ago.
Shae rakes his face while he twists the gold chains and
begins to strangle her.
Shae is a fighter. Her nails draw blood. But Tyrion is a
fighter, too, and a condemned man.
He pulls the chains with all his strength, cutting off Shae’s
air. Blood drips onto her from his slashed hand.
Shae’s face is red from lack of air. Soon her struggles
weaken.
Lost in his own rage, Tyrion pulls the chains tighter and
tighter until he realizes that Shae is motionless, her eyes
open but unseeing.
He releases her. Now that she’s dead his anger seeps away and
he stares with horror at the woman he loved.
He touches her hand but it’s limp, lifeless. He sits beside
her and begins to cry. At this moment he doesn’t care if he
survives the night.
TYRION
I’m sorry... I’m sorry I’m sorry.
Part of him wants to get caught right now, for gold cloaks to
rush into the room and arrest him. But he looks up and sees a
crossbow on the wall [the same crossbow Joffrey demonstrated
to Margaery in Season 3].
The night’s not over yet. Tyrion pulls the silk quilt over
Shae’s body, shrouding her.
He walks over to the crossbow.
INT. TOWER OF THE HAND HALLWAY - NIGHT
Tyrion walks down a dark hall lit by flickering sconces, a
look of grim purpose on his face. He holds the crossbow,
already cocked, a quarrel in the notch.
He reaches a closed door. Light shines under the doorway.
Both hands on the crossbow, Tyrion nudges the door open with
his foot.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 48

INT. PRIVY - NIGHT
Tywin sits in the dimness of the privy tower, bed robe hiked
up around his hips. At the sound of the door opening, he
raises his eyes.
If Tywin’s afraid, he shows no sign.
TYWIN
Tyrion.
Tyrion says nothing. His face bleeds where Shae raked him.
His hand bleeds where she cut him.
TYWIN
Put down that crossbow.
Tyrion shakes his head slowly. After everything, he’s still
afraid of his father.
TYWIN
Who released you?
(off Tyrion’s silence)
Your brother, I expect. He always
had a soft spot for you. Come,
we’ll go and talk in my chambers--
Tywin moves to stand but Tyrion raises the crossbow, quarrel
pointed at Tywin’s heart.
Tywin remains seated, a small smile on his face.
TYWIN
This is how you want to speak to
me?
Tyrion gives a very small nod.
TYWIN
Shaming your father has always
given you pleasure.
TYRION
All my life, you’ve wanted me dead.
A silence between father and son. If Tyrion’s expecting an
apology, he’s not going to get one.
TYWIN
Yes.
(beat)
But you refuse to die. I respect
that. Admire it, even. You fight
for what’s yours.
Tyrion says nothing, crossbow still aimed right at Tywin.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 49
(CONTINUED)
TYWIN
I’d never let them execute you. Is
that what you fear? You think I’d
let Ilyn Payne take your head?
You’re a Lannister! You’re my son.
TYRION
I loved her.
TYWIN
Who?
TYRION
Shae.
TYWIN
Tyrion. Put down the crossbow.
Tyrion shakes his head.
TYRION
I murdered her. With my own hands.
TYWIN
That doesn’t matter--
TYRION
Doesn’t matter?
TYWIN
She was a whore.
TYRION
(raising crossbow)
Say that word again...
TYWIN
And you’ll what? Kill your own
father in the privy? No. You’re my
son. Now enough of this nonsense--
TYRION
I’m your son. And you sentenced me
to die. You knew I didn’t poison
Joffrey. But you sentenced me all
the same. Why?
TYWIN
Enough of this. We’ll go back to my
chambers and speak with some
dignity--
TYRION
I can’t go back there. She’s there.

TYWIN
(rising)
You’re afraid of a dead whore--
Tyrion’s finger clenches. The crossbow whangs just as Tywin
starts to rise. The bolt slams into his belly and Tywin sits
back down with a grunt.
The quarrel has sunk deep, right to the fletching. Blood
seeps out around the shaft.
TYWIN
You shot me.
The pain is shocking, but even more so the realization for
Tywin that this is where he will die, sitting on the privy,
murdered by his own child.
Tyrion loads another bolt.
TYWIN
You are no son of mine.
TYRION
I am your son. I’ve always been
your son.
Tyrion shoots his father in the heart.
He turns and walks away, dropping the crossbow on the floor
as he goes. Behind him, Tywin’s head slumps and his body goes
slack.
INT. DIMLY LIT RED KEEP LANDING - NIGHT
VARYS stands by a bolted door. When he hears two knocks, then
two knocks again, he unbolts the door and opens it to find
Tyrion, bleeding from the face and hand.
VARYS
What have you done?
Tyrion shakes his head. He doesn’t want to talk.
None of this was part of the plan, but Varys is already pot
committed. He closes the door and rebolts it.
VARYS
Quickly.
He leads Tyrion away.
GAME OF THRONES "THE CHILDREN" 51
CONTINUED: (2)
INT. VARYS’ CHAMBER - NIGHT
A large wooden crate with air holes rests on the floor. It
looks exactly like the crate that contained a sorcerer in S3.
Tyrion does not want to get into that crate.
VARYS
Trust me, my friend. I’ve brought
you this far.
Tyrion takes a deep breath and steps inside the crate, with
the aid of a footstool and Varys’ hand.
There is some straw in the crate to make it a bit more
comfortable, along with a drinking gourd and a bundle wrapped
with string.
Once Tyrion’s positioned he looks up at Varys and nods.
Varys lifts the lid of the crate and fixes it into position,
leaving Tyrion in darkness, alone save for the sound of his
own breathing and the thwack, thwack as Varys nails the lid
in place.
EXT. KING’S LANDING HARBOR - NIGHT
Two BURLY LONGSHOREMEN carry the crate across the gangplank
and onto the deck of a merchant ship, setting it alongside
other crates just like it.
Varys watches from the dock. He glances up at the Red Keep,
looming above the sleeping city.
Varys sighs. He’s grown rather fond of the dirty old town.
But now it’s time to leave. He walks across the gangplank,
onto the deck of the ship, hands in his sleeves, ignoring the
SAILORS who bustle around him.
He stands next to Tyrion’s crate as the longshoremen step off
the ship and the sailors pull in the gangplank.
EXT. SALTPANS - DAY
Arya rides her pony toward the docks of a small port town.
EXT. SALTPANS HARBOR - DAY
A trading galley is docked here, its purple sails furled.
SAILORS roll barrels aboard. The CAPTAIN stands on the dock,
checking over his inventory.

ARYA
I want to see the captain.
The Captain doesn’t look up from his inventory.
CAPTAIN
(Braavosi accent)
You’re seeing him.
ARYA
I want to go north, to the Wall.
The Captain glances at her.
CAPTAIN
No you don’t.
ARYA
I can pay.
She offers the Captain the coin purse she took from the
Hound. The Captain doesn’t bother taking the purse.
CAPTAIN
There’s nothing in the north but
ice and war and pirates.
ARYA
I wouldn’t need a cabin.
The Captain isn’t an unkind man, he’s just a busy one who
doesn’t have time to speak with a strange urchin girl. He
starts to walk away. Arya pursues him.
ARYA
Please. I could work. Scrubbing the
floors, or--
CAPTAIN
I’m not going north, child. I’m
going home.
Arya looks around the small harbor, a stranger in a strange
land with nowhere to go.
ARYA
Where’s home?
CAPTAIN
The Free City of Braavos.
The Captain’s about to board his ship.
ARYA
Wait. I have something else.

CAPTAIN
This... how did you...

He touches his forehead with two fingers.

Valar dohaeris.
He beckons for her to board.
CAPTAIN
Of course, you shall have a cabin.
EXT. SHIP - DAY
Arya stands at the stern as the ship sails out to sea. She
watches Westeros recede behind her. In a single masterful
crane shot that secures the camera operator’s legendary
status, we follow Arya as she walks to the bow, gracefully
sidestepping the busy sailors.
Standing by the figurehead (a gilded naked woman), Arya looks
east, across the waves to whatever comes next.

The ships in the slaver armada bombard the city with their
trebuchets.
Volleys of flaming projectiles soar over the beach and into
the city.
INT. GREAT PYRAMID - PENTHOUSE - DAY
The sound of the impacts and the distant chaos they cause are
audible throughout this scene between DAENERYS TARGARYEN and
TYRION LANNISTER, adding further pressure to an already
pressurized situation.
Tyrion flinches each time a projectile lands near the
pyramid, because he’s human and it’s a natural human
reaction.
Dany never flinches. She is not the same woman who flew away
from Daznak’s Pit on the back of a dragon. She is changed,
changed utterly, a terrible beauty glaring at Tyrion.
BOOM!
TYRION
Despite appearances, I think you’ll
find the city’s on the rise --
BOOM!
That one was close.
TYRION
Perhaps we should take shelter.
DANY
The city is on the rise?
TYRION
Meereen is strong. Commerce has
returned to the markets. The people
are behind you--
BOOM!
Dany watches Tyrion flinching, regarding him as the snake
regards the mouse.
TYRION
Well, not all the people, of
course. No ruler who ever lived had
the support of all the people. But
the rebirth of Meereen is the cause
of this violence.
BOOM!
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 1.
TYRION
The Masters cannot let Meereen
succeed. Because if Meereen
succeeds-- a city without slavery,
a city without Masters--
BOOM!
TYRION
--it proves that no one needs a
Master.
Dany nods. He’s finally starting to make sense.
BOOM!
Tyrion flinches again, and is a bit embarrassed when he sees
Dany coolly regarding him with a slight smile.
DANY
Good. Shall we begin?
TYRION
Do we have a plan?
DANY
I will crucify the Masters. I will
set their fleet afire, kill every
last one of their soldiers, and
return their cities to the dirt.
That is my plan.
(beat)
You don’t approve.
Tyrion knows he must tread carefully here.
TYRION
You once told me you knew what your
father was.
BOOM!
TYRION
Did you know his plans for King's
Landing, when the Lannister armies
were at his gates?
BOOM!
TYRION
Probably not. He told my brother,
and Jaime told me. Do you know what
wildfire is?
(off Dany’s nod)
He had caches of it hidden under
the Red Keep, under the guild
halls, the Sept of Baelor, all the
major thoroughfares.

GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 2.
BOOM!
TYRION
He would have burned every one of
his citizens, the loyal ones and
the traitors, every man, woman, and
child. That's why Jaime killed him.
DANY
This is entirely different.
TYRION
You’re talking about destroying
cities. It’s not entirely
different.
(beat)
I'd like to suggest an alternate
approach.
BOOM!
That one hit the balcony. Outside, smoke and fire. Debris
flies in through the window.
EXT. PLATEAU OUTSIDE MEEREEN - DAY
An elevated plateau outside the city with good views of both
Slavers Bay and the Meereenese skyline.
RAZDAL MO ERAZ, BELICHO PAENYMION, and YEZZAN, the slaver
envoys from earlier in the season, stand with a dozen
BODYGUARDS.
Dany stands with Tyrion, MISSANDEI, GREY WORM and a dozen
UNSULLIED.
Razdal smiles at Dany.
RAZDAL
Once before I offered you peace. If
you had not been so arrogant, you
could have returned to your
homeland with a fleet of ships.
Instead you will flee Slavers Bay
on foot, like the Beggar Queen you
are.
TYRION
We’re here to discuss terms of
surrender, not to trade insults.
YEZZAN
The terms are simple. You and your
foreign friends will abandon the

DANY
We obviously didn't communicate
clearly. We're here to discuss your
surrender, not mine.
The envoys exchange glances and laugh. Oh, how they laugh.
RAZDAL
I imagine it’s difficult, adjusting
to the new reality. Your reign is
over.
DANY
My reign has just begun.
Yezzan notices something in the distance, a black dot in the
sky that grows larger and larger.
Soon all the envoys and their bodyguards see it.
Dany never turns to look at the approaching DROGON.
She doesn’t have to look. She only allows the faintest hint
of a smile. A smile that says: my tyranny’s not ended,
motherfucker. It’s only just begun.
Drogon screams across the sky.
The Unsullied back-up as Drogon lands atop the plateau,
causing the envoys to shrink back in fear and their
bodyguards to raise their spears.
Dany climbs on. No hesitation any more: she looks as if she
was born to ride dragons, and indeed she was. They take to
the sky, displaying Dany’s control of the greatest war
machine the world has ever seen.

EXT. SKIES ABOVE MEEREEN - DAY
She flies past Daznak’s pit, past other landmarks of Meereen,
toward the Great Pyramid.
EXT. BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY
Unsullied STRONGMEN roll back the giant stone blocking the
entrance to the dragon prison, and hurry the fuck out of the
way. We move in slowly on the dark entrance.
VISERION emerges into the daylight, smashing the stone
entryway on his way out. RHAEGAL follows. They look a lot
healthier than they did the last time we saw them.
They blink in the strong sunlight. And hear their brother’s
calls overhead.
They flap their wings, testing. They haven’t flown in a long
time.
Viserion goes for it taking four quick steps and taking to
the air. Rhaegal follows. The first few flaps are halting,
but they quickly find their balance again, and head toward
their mother and brother overhead.
EXT. SKIES ABOVE MEEREEN - CONTINUOUS
Dany watches them fly towards her, crying their delight in
their freedom.
She and Drogon lead them across the sky, toward the bay, and
the warships.
EXT. GATES OF MEEREEN - DAY
Panicking and disorientated, KATHE, a freed slave, careers
into the SONS OF THE HARPY outside Meereen as they continue
to mow down any FREEDMEN trying to escape the city.
Quickly, she tries to push past them, but she’s not fast
enough and they're quite good at butchering unarmed
civilians. She’s stabbed in the back and falls to the ground
before she can get very far.
A sound like distant waves crashing on the shore forces the
Sons of the Harpy to turn, en masse.
A tsunami of DOTHRAKI SCREAMERS gallops toward them, earning
their names with their bloodcurdling screams. 40,000 fighting
men on horseback, arakhs raised.
And in the front of this blood tide, DAARIO NAHARIS, leading
the charge.

We don’t see the full attack play out, because the conclusion
is foregone.
A severed masked head spins into the air.
EXT. SHIP - DAY
The SAILORS and SLAVER MERCENARY SOLDIERS aboard stare up
fearfully, as Drogon and the other two dragons head toward
the ships.
Toward their ship.
Three huge dragons, circling in the sky above their ship.
Too late, the sailors and soldiers realize what horrible
career choices they have made.
EXT. SKIES ABOVE MEEREEN - DAY
DANY
Dracarys.
Drogon breathes fire upon the warship. The other two dragons
follow suit.
It’s an awe-inspiring sight. Three columns of flame, thick as
tree trunks, reducing boat and crew to ash in a matter of
seconds.
EXT. SLAVERS BAY - DAY
The rest of the Slaver navy gets the message loud and clear.
SAILORS abandon ship en masse, jumping into the water and
swimming for safety wherever they can find it.
Weighed down by armor and weapons, many of them go under.
EXT. PLATEAU - DAY
The Unsullied on the plateau shift their spears to attack
mode in one synchronized move.
Grey Worm addresses the Envoys’ bodyguards.
GREY WORM
(in Valyrian)
You men have a choice. Fight and
die for Masters who would never
fight and die for you. Or go home,
to your families.

Thank you for the armada. Our queen

Now. The last time we spoke we made
a pact. You violated that pact. You
declared war upon us. And though
our queen has a forgiving nature...
this cannot be forgiven.
The envoys have not quite processed their new reality yet.
They look between Tyrion and the Unsullied spearheads,
pointed right at their hearts.
MISSANDEI
Our queen insists that one of you
must die, as punishment for your
crimes.
TYRION
It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying?
RAZDAL
(pointing at Yezzan)
Him! He should die.
BELICHO
(re: Yezzan)
Yes, yes, him!
YEZZAN
(stunned)
My friends--
RAZDAL
He’s not one of us, he’s an
outsider, low born, he does not
speak for us.
Tyrion nods to Grey Worm. Grey Worm approaches Yezzan,
drawing his dagger.
YEZZAN
Please, please--
Grey Worm slashes, and in an impressive feat of stunt work
and VFX, cuts both Razdal and Belicho’s throats with a single
move.
The two Masters fall to the ground, dying, clutching at their
opened throat.
Yezzan gasps, almost in a state of shock, as Grey Worm
sheathes his dagger.

retribution, or ideas about
returning the slave cities to their
former glory, remind them what
happened when Daenerys Stormborn
and her dragons came to Meereen.
Tyrion pats Yezzan on the back and walks away, followed by
Grey Worm, Missandei and the Unsullied.
Yezzan stands alone with the bodies of Razdal and Belicho,
still not sure what just happened to him.
EXT. WINTERFELL FIELD - DAY
JON SNOW, SANSA STARK, DAVOS SEAWORTH, TORMUND, young LADY
LYANNA MORMONT, and three other NORTHERN LORDS sit on
horseback, awaiting the arrival of Ramsay and his contingent
for a parley.
They look beautiful and majestic, sitting there with
Winterfell in the deep background.
They stare forward, sober, watching the approach of RAMSAY
BOLTON, LORD KARSTARK, SMALLJON UMBER, and five other
NORTHERN LORDS, riding across the vast field.
JON
(looking at Sansa)
You don’t have to be here.
SANSA
(looking forward)
Yes, I do.
Ramsay and his Northern loyalists arrive, halting in front of
Jon and his supporters.
Ramsay smiles, cheerful as ever and addresses Sansa.
RAMSAY
My beloved wife. I’ve missed you
terribly.
(to Jon)
Thank you for returning Lady Bolton
safely.
Jon stares back at Ramsay. He would kill him this second if
he could.

RAMSAY
Now, dismount and kneel before me.
Surrender your army and proclaim me
the true Lord of Winterfell and
Warden of the North. I will pardon
you for deserting the Night’s
Watch. I will pardon these
treasonous lords for betraying my
house.
Jon continues to stare at Ramsay. Ramsay apes Jon’s glare
before laughing.
RAMSAY
Come, bastard. You don’t have the
men. You don’t have the horses. And
you don’t have Winterfell. Why lead
those poor souls in to slaughter?
There’s no need for a battle. Get
off your horse. Kneel. I am a man
of mercy.
Sansa stares at Ramsay. If Jon would kill Ramsay, Sansa would
skin him living.
Everyone else looks at Jon, waiting for their leader’s
response.
JON
You’re right. There’s no need for a
battle.
Ramsay grins.
JON
Thousands of men don’t have to die.
Only one of us.
Now Tormund smiles.
JON
Let’s end this the old way. You
against me.
Sansa and Davos exchange a look. This wasn’t part of the
plan.
Smalljon grins, too. Jon might be the enemy, but Smalljon
admires the kid’s balls.
Jon stares at Ramsay and Ramsay stares back, neither man
backing down.
Until Ramsay finally laughs.
RAMSAY
I keep hearing stories about you,
bastard.

GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 9.
The way people in the North talk
about you, you're the greatest
swordsman who ever walked. Maybe
you are that good. Maybe not. I
don't know if I'd beat you. I know
that my army will beat yours. I
have six thousand men. You have...
what, half that? Not even?
JON
Aye, you have the numbers. Will
your men want to fight for you when
they hear you would not fight for
them?
For a moment it looks as if Jon is succeeding at provoking
Ramsay. Ramsay doesn’t like being called a coward. He wants
to skin this impudent bastard. But he restrains himself and
smiles, turning to Sansa.
RAMSAY
He’s good! Very good!
(to Jon)
Tell me: will you let your little
brother die because you’re too
proud to surrender?
SANSA
How do we know you have him?
Ramsay looks at Sansa. For a long uncomfortable beat he just
looks at her and she returns his gaze.
Finally Ramsay gestures to the Smalljon, who reaches behind
his saddle.
He tosses Shaggydog’s mouldering head onto the field between
the riders. Unmistakably a dire wolf head.
RAMSAY
Now, if you want to save [your
little brother--]
SANSA
You’re going to die tomorrow, Lord
Bolton.
She says this with such conviction, such certainty, even
Ramsay is momentarily silenced.
SANSA
Sleep well.
She turns and rides off.
Ramsay smiles and shakes his head.

RAMSAY
And you’re all fine looking men. My
dogs are desperate to meet you. I
haven’t fed them in seven days.
They’re ravenous! I wonder which
parts they’ll try first. Your eyes?
Your balls? We’ll find out soon
enough.
He gathers his reins and nods to Jon.
RAMSAY
In the morning then, bastard.
He rides off with his Loyalists. Jon watches him go.
INT. JON’S COMMAND TENT - NIGHT
The scene is tense in the lantern lit tent.
Jon, Davos, Tormund and the Stark-loyalist Northern lords
prepare the battle plan. They stand around a table on which
sits a rough map of the surrounding area.
Sansa listens in. She is not a part of the inner circle, and
this should be clear from the blocking.
JON
If he was smart, he’d stay inside
the walls of Winterfell and wait us
out.
DAVOS
That’s not his way. He knows the
North is watching. If the other
houses sense weakness on his part,
they’ll stop fearing him. He can’t
have that. Fear is his power.
Sansa listens to all this. She knows Ramsay better than any
of them, but they’re not asking her opinion.
JON
It’s his weakness, too. His men
don’t want to fight for him.
They’re forced to fight for him. If
they feel the tide turning--

TORMUND
It’s not his men that worry me.
It’s his horses. I know what
mounted knights can do to us.
(to Davos)
You and Stannis cut through us like
piss through snow.
JON
(pointing to map)
We’re digging trenches all along
our flanks. They won’t be able to
hit us the way Stannis hit you,
with a double envelopment...
He notices the blank look on Tormund’s face.
JON
A pincer move.
Still no sign of recognition from Tormund.
JON
They won’t be able to hit us from
the sides.
TORMUND
Good.
DAVOS
The crucial thing is to let them
charge us. They’ve got the numbers.
We need the patience. Ramsay wants
to destroy us. He wants to show the
North he’s the only true power.
(demonstrating on map)
If we let him buckle our center,
he’ll pursue. And we’ll have him
surrounded on three sides.
TORMUND
Did you really think that cunt
would fight you, man to man?
JON
No. But I wanted to make him angry.
I want him coming at us full tilt.
DAVOS
We should all get some sleep.
Tormund slaps Jon’s shoulder.
TORMUND
Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp
tomorrow.
Davos nods to Jon. Everyone but Jon and Sansa exit.

When they’re alone:
SANSA
So you’ve met the enemy, drawn up
your battle plans.
JON
Aye, for what they’re worth.
SANSA
You’ve known him for the space of a
single conversation. You and your
trusted advisors. And you sit
around, making your plans on how to
defeat a man you don’t know.
Jon is smart enough not to interrupt.
SANSA
I lived with him. I know the way
his mind works. I know how he likes
to hurt people. Did it ever once
occur to you that I might have some
insight?
JON
You’re right. I should have asked
you.
SANSA
You think he’s going to fall into
your trap, but he won’t. He’s the
one who lays traps.
JON
He’s over confident--
SANSA
He plays with people. He’s far
better at it than you are. He’s
been doing it all his life.
Jon has been patiently taking his lumps but this last insult
gets under his skin.
JON
Aye, and what have I been doing all
my life? Playing with broom sticks?
I’ve fought beyond the Wall,
against worse than Ramsay Bolton.
I’ve defended the Wall from worse
than Ramsay Bolton.
SANSA
You don’t know him!
Jon calms himself. He doesn’t need to fight with his own
sister on the night before he battles for their home.

GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 13.
JON
All right. Tell me: what should we

SANSA
We’ll never get him back.
(beat)
Rickon is Ned Stark’s trueborn son.
Which makes him a greater threat to
Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me,
a girl. As long as he lives,
Ramsay’s claim to Winterfell will
be contested. Which means he won’t
live long.
JON
We can’t give up on our brother.
SANSA
Listen to me. Please listen to me.
He wants you to make a mistake.
JON
Of course he does.
(gesturing at map)
What should I do differently?
SANSA
I don’t know. I don’t know anything
about battles. Just don’t do what
he wants you to do.
JON
(a trifle impatient)
Aye, that’s good advice.
SANSA
You think that’s obvious.
JON
Well, it is a bit obvious.
SANSA
If you had asked my advice earlier,
I would have told you not to attack
Winterfell until we had a larger
force. Or is that obvious too?
JON
(increasingly heated)
When will we have a larger force?
We pleaded with every house that
would have us. The Blackfish can’t
have us. We’re lucky to have this
many men.
SANSA
It’s not enough.

No, it’s not enough. It’s what we

greater odds.
Sansa knows there’s no point continuing the argument. She
moves toward the tent entrance, where she stops and looks
back at him.
SANSA
If Ramsay wins... I’m not going
back there alive. Do you understand
me?
JON
I won’t ever let him touch you
again. I promise. I’ll protect you.
SANSA
No one can protect me. No one can
protect anyone.
She exits the tent, leaving Jon alone.
EXT. ALLIES’ ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
Davos walks with Tormund through the encampment, a strange
mix of wildling tents and tents from the various northern
houses represented.
Save for SENTRIES on duty, most of the men sleep inside their
dark tents.
DAVOS
You think there’s hope?
TORMUND
I’ve never seen these Bolton
fuckers fight. And they’ve never
seen the Free Folks fight. So yes,
there’s hope.
He glances at Davos.
TORMUND
You want to avenge your king, don’t
you?
DAVOS
It wasn’t the Boltons that defeated
Stannis. It was Stannis himself.

I loved the man. He lifted me up
and made me something. But he had
demons in his skull, whispering
foul things.

They have stopped beside Tormund’s tent. The wildling

TORMUND
You saw these demons?
DAVOS
What? No, it’s... it’s a manner of
speaking.
(off Tormund’s confusion)
Not actual demons.
TORMUND
Huh. Well, you loved that cunt
Stannis, and I loved the man he
burnt, Mance Rayder. Mance didn’t
have demons in his skull. He didn’t
torch people or listen to some red
witch. I believed in him. I thought
he was the man to lead us through
the Long Night. But I was wrong,
just like you.
DAVOS
Maybe that was our mistake.
Believing in kings.
TORMUND
Jon Snow’s not a king.
DAVOS
No, he’s not.
TORMUND
I need a good drink to help me
sleep the night before a fight. You
want some? I have a jug of sour
goat’s milk stronger than any of
that grape water you Southern twats
like sucking on.
DAVOS
Ah, thank you, it does sound
delicious, but I’d better keep a
clear head. I can never sleep the
night before a battle.
TORMUND
So what do you do all night?

I walk. Think and walk, think and

INT. MELISANDRE’S TENT - NIGHT
MELISANDRE looks into the brazier flames. This activity

perhaps it's just that she's approaching it with less

My lady?
MELISANDRE
Come in.
Jon enters.

MELISANDRE
I... interpret His signs. As well
as I can.

But if the Lord didn’t want me to
bring you back, how did I bring you
back?
Jon has no answer.
MELISANDRE
I have no power. Only what He gives
me. And He gave me you.
JON
Why?
MELISANDRE
I don’t know.
She genuinely doesn’t know. It has been centuries since she
admitted that she doesn’t know.
MELISANDRE
Maybe you're only needed for this
small part of His plan, and nothing
else. Maybe He brought you here to
die again.

Whomever Tyrion is speaking to, he is not positively
predisposed toward them:
TYRION
Last time we saw each other was at
Winterfell, yes?
THEON GREYJOY nods, knowing full well what kind of person he
was the last time he spoke to Tyrion.
Dany and Tyrion meet with YARA GREYJOY and Theon, with a few
Unsullied keeping them silent company.
TYRION
You were making jokes about my
height, I seem to recall. Everyone
who makes jokes about a dwarf’s
height thinks he’s the first person
ever to make jokes about a dwarf’s
height. “The height of nobility,”
“a man of your stature,” “someone
to look up to.” You’re all making
the same five or six jokes.
THEON
It was a long time ago.
TYRION
It was. How have things been going
for you since then? Not so well, I
gather. Can’t imagine you would
have murdered the Stark boys if
things had been going well.
THEON
I didn’t murder the Stark boys. But
I did things that were just as bad,

But then, we all live complicated

Dany cuts to the chase, speaking to Theon:
DANY
You’ve brought us a hundred ships
from the Iron Fleet, and men to
sail them. In return, I expect you
want me to support your claim to
the Throne of the Iron Islands?
Among other things?
THEON
Not my claim. Hers.
This surprises both Dany and Tyrion.
DANY
And what’s wrong with you?
Theon and Yara look at each other. Talk about a loaded
question.
THEON
I’m not fit to rule.
TYRION
Well, we can agree upon that, at
least.
DANY
(to Yara)
Has the Iron Islands ever had a
Queen before?
YARA
No more than Westeros.
Touché.
THEON
Our Uncle Euron returned home,
after a long absence. He murdered
our father, and took the Salt
Throne from Yara. He would have
murdered us if we’d stayed.

Possibly. Barely.
Something occurs to Tyrion.

There are more than a hundred ships

THEON
There are. And Euron is building
more. He’s going to offer them all
to you.
DANY
So why shouldn’t I wait for him.
THEON
The Iron Fleet isn’t all he’s
bringing. He also wants to give
you...
YARA
His “big cock,” I think he said.
Euron’s offer is also an offer of
marriage, you see. You won’t get
one without the other.

any marriage demands.
YARA
I would never demand. But I’m up
for anything, really.
Dany tries not to betray that she likes this girl.

EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD - JON’S TROOPS
The Battle of the Bastards begins.
The battlefield is about 400m long, a small valley bordered
by two hills peaked with trees. At one end is a forest of
high trees (the Stark side). At the other is a ridge with a
reasonably soft incline that plateaus and stretches out to
Winterfell in the distance (the Bolton side).
The Stark armies are on their end of the battlefield, arrayed
in pitched battle formation.
DAVOS oversees the LONGBOW ARCHERS on the flanks, standing
behind defensive caltrop-shaped structures. Thousands of
arrows are divided into large bundles.
Tormund stands at the ready, overseeing the large WILDLING
INFANTRY force that is the single biggest contingent on the
Stark side. WUN-WUN is the centerpiece of this wildling
infantry formation.
Other, NON-WILDLING INFANTRY stand side-by-side with the
wildlings.
And in front: a rank of CAVALRY, organized according to
house. We see the banners of Mormont, Mazin, Hornwood. Steam
comes from their horses’ muzzles.
Everyone stands stock-still, staring across the battlefield.
Jon rides his destrier through the cavalry to stand out in
front of his army and looks across the battlefield at
EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY’S TROOPS
The BOLTON ARMY, with Winterfell in the background behind
them. They also have archers, infantry and cavalry in a
similar arrangement to the Starks, only there are noticeably
more of all.

GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 23.
Crucified flayed bodies hang head-down on Bolton Xs, roasting
over eight large bonfires that flank either side of the army,
a twisted form of intimidation only Ramsay could have thought
of.
Banners for the Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, and all
the other quisling houses abound.
LORD KARSTARK sits his horse at the front of the cavalry, war
lance in hand. The Boltons have far more cavalry than the
Starks, three ranks to the Stark one.
SMALLJON UMBER stands with the infantry, eager to separate
some people from their limbs. He takes a huge pull off a
leather-covered flask of something very alcoholic.
On ground level: a set of horse hooves walk through the
Bolton ranks, past infantry, past cavalry.
We see him from behind as he emerges at the front of his
army. Both the silhouette and the deference he is shown make
it clear that this is Ramsay.
EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
Ramsay is very far away from him, but Jon can see him
dismount.
A figure is just visible between the horses behind Ramsay.
Jon dismounts himself, and steps forward several paces to get
a better look as Ramsay pulls on a rope and Rickon stumbles
forward into view, his hands bound in front of him with the
end of the rope.
EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
We’re with Ramsay as he pulls Rickon alongside him, like a
dog on a lead.
He walks the boy out toward the center of the battlefield,
arm around his shoulder.
EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
Jon steps forward, watching intently.
Ramsay stops about twenty yards from his own lines. He draws
his dagger and holds it up for Jon to see.
Jon, Davos and Tormund watch, furious and powerless.
CONTINUED:
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 24.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
Ramsay lowers the dagger to Rickon’s bound wrists, frees his
hands and resheathes the dagger. He tousles Rickon’s hair,
and speaks to him.
RAMSAY
Do you like games, little man?
Let’s play a game.
He points to Jon.
RAMSAY
Run to your brother. The sooner you
make it to him, the sooner you get
to see him again.
One of RAMSAY’S SOLDIERS is approaching him in the
background, carrying something.
RAMSAY
That’s it. That’s the game. Easy.
Ready? Go!
Rickon starts walking across the battlefield.
RAMSAY
No, you have to run, remember?
Those are the rules!
Rickon turns. He sees the approaching soldier, and what he’s
carrying: a mean looking longbow, and a quiver of arrows.
Rickon turns and runs.
Smalljon and Karstark grin. They like this game.
Ramsay takes the bow and quiver from the soldier (who returns
to the line). He takes his time nocking an arrow and drawing
the bow.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
When Jon sees the telltale archery pose and motion, he turns
and sprints back toward his horse.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
Ramsay looses the arrow.
Rickon runs harder.
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 25.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
Without stopping, Jon turns to make sure Rickon is still
running.
Ramsay’s arrow misses Rickon, but not by that much.
Jon reaches his horse, and does a front-jumping mount, hands
on the horse’s neck, half-twisting in midair to land forward
in the saddle.
He kicks his horse forward and gallops for Rickon.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
Ramsay nocks another arrow, taking his time. He draws. He
fires.
The arrow hits the ground closer to Rickon this time.
Rickon runs harder. Jon digs his heels into his horse,
driving it faster.
Ramsay really appreciates the high level of sport going on
here. He draws and fires again.
This arrow sails right over Rickon’s shoulder to plant itself
in the ground a few yards ahead of him; Rickon tramples it as
he runs.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
Jon is closing on Rickon. He leans out from his saddle,
reaching down with an outstretched arm, ready to scoop up his
little brother.
He’s so close. He sees the hope in the boy's face.
And watches it turn to confusion, as an arrowhead punches
through Rickon's chest.
Rickon falls.
[N.B.: his body is closer to Stark lines than Bolton lines.]
Jon looks down at Rickon. The boy’s eyes are still open, his
face a fixed mask of shock. He is dead.
EXT. BATTLEMENTS - JON CAVALRY
Tormund shakes his head. He knows Jon can’t hear him, but he
says it anyway:
TORMUND
Don’t.
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 26.
Tormund waits with dread for Jon’s response.
Davos doesn’t: he runs along the cavalry line, telling them
all:
DAVOS
Prepare to charge. Prepare to
charge.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
Ramsay waits.
Umber smiles as he drinks, glad that Rickon is dead.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
Jon does not look back at his own lines. His gaze remains
straight ahead, focused on Ramsay, the object of his mounting
rage.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
Ramsay smiles. Perfect. He walks back to his horse, in no
great hurry, then nods towards the Bolton archers. The BOLTON
ARCHER CAPTAIN yells:
BOLTON ARCHER CAPTAIN
Nock!
The Bolton archers nock arrows.
BOLTON ARCHER CAPTAIN
Draw!
They draw.
Ramsay swings back into the saddle of his horse, in time to
watch:
BOLTON ARCHER CAPTAIN
Loose!
The Bolton archers loose a wave of arrows in Jon’s direction.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
Jon charges towards Ramsay, one man against an army.
Arrows fall in the space Jon just occupied, puncturing
Rickon’s dead body.
CONTINUED:
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 27.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CAVALRY
Davos calls the charge:
DAVOS
Go! Go! Go! Follow your commander!
The Stark cavalry pushes forward -- a great charge across a
vast, snow-strewn field, wolf banners flapping.
Tormund isn’t going to be left out. With a rebel yell, he
signals his wildling infantrymen to follow the cavalry.
The wildlings are ready and eager. Wun-Wun runs forward, and
the others come with him. Wun-Wun run fast!
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
Jon urges his horse forward as a wave of Bolton arrows land
all around him.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
Karstark looks to Ramsay: what are we waiting for?
But Ramsay is holding, a psychotic William Wallace, watching
the Starks come.
Another wave of Bolton arrows lets fly.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
An arrow drills through the neck of Jon’s horse.
The horse whinnies in agony and goes down, throwing Jon end
over end.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
Ramsay smiles.
RAMSAY
Now.
Karstark yells to the Bolton cavalry:
KARSTARK
Cavalry! Charge!
Out goes Karstark and the Bolton cavalry.
Ramsay stays put, at a slight elevation, as his forces stream
forward around him. This allows him to survey his forces (and
us to do the same from his perspective).
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 28.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
Jon staggers to his feet. The fall has dirtied him, but he’s
unhurt for the moment.
He stares at what’s coming (in close profile), and the camera
circles behind him to show us what’s coming: the entire
Bolton cavalry, thousands of them, galloping straight for
him, lances leveled.
Jon exhales. This is the end, then.
He draws Longclaw and readies himself.
The sound of pounding hooves and war cries is so loud we
don’t realize we’re hearing it from both directions.
The Stark cavalry swoops past Jon a moment before he would be
overrun, colliding with the Bolton cavalry.
We are with Jon who is right in the center of the action as
the two cavalry clash.
Flashes of the colossal impact, horse on horse, rider on
rider.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
RAMSAY
Nock!
The Bolton archers nock their arrows.
SMALLJON
Our cavalry’s engaged with his.
RAMSAY
Yes, and we have twice their
numbers. Reducing the field’s in
our interest. Simple arithmetic.
The Smalljon nods in acceptance: yup. Stands to reason.
RAMSAY
(to the archers)
Pull! Loose!
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAVOS MOMENT
A CAPTAIN OF THE ARCHERS shouts to Davos:
CAPTAIN
Should we loose?
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 29.
DAVOS
No. We’ll kill our own men! Stand
down.
The Stark archers lower their bows.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CAVALRY MOMENT
Jon must use every fibre of his being to dodge, weave and
survive the chaos around him as panicked horses careen out of
the smoke and fog from every angle in one lovely Wagnerian
shot.
It’s like being caught in the middle of the busiest
intersection in town.
The Bolton archers fire another barrage, and another.
All around Stark horses wild with pain throw other riders,
who trip up still more riders.
Bolton riders are felled by Bolton arrows as well, but as
Ramsay pointed out, the ratio only gets worse for the Starks
as men on both sides are shot off their mounts.
Jon pivots out the way of one horse only to walk right into
the path of another, its dead rider bouncing limply in the
saddle.
He throws himself to the ground then scrambles to avoid yet
another panicked animal. This time he manages to thrust his
sword out and take the rider out just as a new wave of arrows
pepper the horse and it crashes to the ground.
From nowhere a Bolton soldier runs at him. Jon makes short
work of him before another soldier appears.
Their frenzied sword fight is cut short when a large horse
hurtles through frame, mowing down the unlucky soldier.
As Jon backs up a giant stallion bears down on him. By the
time he sees it it’s too late and then, out of nowhere a
riderless horse t-bones the first and the two crash to the
ground, leaving a startled but miraculously alive Jon still
standing, sword in hand.
Through the smoke from the fires beyond Jon begins to see the
level of carnage the cavalry charge has created in the form
of a pile of bodies, a natural obstruction created by the
corpses of horses and men.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAVOS/CALTROPS MOMENT
Davos has no intention of sitting the battle out.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 30.
DAVOS
(to Stark Archer Captain)
We may as well be taking shits back
here.
(to all)
Forward!
The Stark archers leave behind the safety of their defensive
caltrops and move toward the battle.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
As more die the pile of dead men and horses is becoming a
feature of battlefield geography, blocking forward motion.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY
Ramsay speaks to Smalljon.
RAMSAY
It’s time. Go.
Smalljon grins. About fucking time.
He turns to his infantry.
SMALLJON
Who owns the North?
INFANTRY
We do!
SMALLJON
Show me!
He turns and runs toward the fray, leading by example, and
the infantry howls and follows after him.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - SMALLJON MOMENT - CONTINUOUS
Smalljon uses the body pile as a natural divider in the
center of the field, directing half his infantry to one side
of it and half to the other.
Smalljon himself, along with a bodyguard of ten men, charges
straight up the hill of bodies.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT - CONTINUOUS
Covered from head to toe in mud and blood, Jon frantically
fights for his survival. Fog of war flashes: Jon slashes
desperately at the men trying to kill him. Takes a hit, kills
the man who scored it. Uses another as a human shield.
Catches an arrow in their eye socket.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 31.
But they are coming thick and fast now and there’s simply too
many.
Jon turns to see a Bolton infantryman lunging at him. He
dodges out of the way, and the Bolton infantryman presses his
advantage, swinging hard on Jon, once, twice, three times...
Until Tormund runs the Bolton through.
The Stark infantry has arrived at the battle line. Wun-Wun is
with them too. He swats a mounted Bolton and his horse out
of the way, and is quickly followed by Davos and the Stark
archers, shooting arrows as they arrive.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY
Ramsay watches the beginning of the double envelopment
maneuver unfold.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - ARCHERS/DAVOS/JON MOMENT
Using the advantage of his height Wun-Wun howls a warning at
what he sees beyond the body pile:
Hundreds and hundreds of Bolton infantry, surround the Stark
army from either side of the body pile. Each Bolton
infantryman carries a 6ft tall rectangular shield. In a
synchronised lethal pincer movement, they use their raised
shields to create an impenetrable wall.
Jon, Tormund, Davos and Wun-Wun watch the Bolton infantry
complete the circle of shields with a cordon several men
deep.
Stark archers take some of them out -- but the circle starts
to close, bringing the archers into weapon range where
they’re murdered by the score in their light armor.
The circle tightens forcing the Starks into a smaller and
smaller space. It is clear the Boltons have the upper hand
and the Starks are fucked.
Davos isn’t giving up. He rallies the men around him.
DAVOS
With me, lads! Break their lines!
They push forward towards the wall of shields.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
Ramsay is pleased. The success of the envelopment is clear.
CONTINUED:
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 32.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - SMALLJON/JON/TORMUND MOMENT
The pincer movement has created a quagmire of bodies as the
Stark forces are slowly being pushed back by the Bolton
phalanx, crushed against each other so tightly it’s barely
possible to swing an axe without hitting one of your own.
Smalljon Umber is carving through the chaotic crush of
wildlings with his greatsword. He's a badass of the first
order, the strongest man on the field who isn't Wun-Wun, and
he’s in his element.
Tormund sees this beast cutting down his people, and he goes
to stop him.
Jon is in berserker mode, fighting like a madman but he’s
been pushed back towards the body pile, and into Smalljon’s
path.
Slicing through an advancing Bolton, Jon spins round and
locks eyes with Smalljon. Both men pause momentarily,
accepting the challenge.
But as Jon starts his advance, he is knocked to the mud by a
swarm of retreating wildlings. He tries to get up but is
pinned down by the stampede of fighting and men escaping the
phalanx.
The Smalljon sees Tormund coming through the crush and
welcomes the contest. The bearded wildling goes up against
the bearded Northman, with a ferocity that would make a
Southerner piss his pants.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
At the epicentre of the scrum, Jon struggles against the
continual force of bodies surrounding him. We see other
soldiers squashed by the weight of those above them, adding
to the body pile.
Jon gasps for air, grabbing hold of anything he can,
frantically trying to get to his feet.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - SMALLJON MOMENT
Tormund finally manages to plunge his sword into the
Smalljon's belly.
This really pisses the Smalljon off. He grabs Tormund, lifts
him off the ground and head-butts him so hard Tormund's nose
bursts open. And then again.
Tormund's face is starting to look like a Jack-o'-lantern two
weeks after Halloween. He struggles as best he can, punching
at Smalljon's face, but the big man took a sword through the
belly, punches aren't going to faze him.
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 33.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
Fighting his way out, Jon clambers to the top of the body
pile where he has a perfect view of the carnage: Bolton men
in red X helmets, grinding up Starks in an atrocity mill.
The crush of men desperately trying to stave off the
inevitable.
The Bolton soldiers have finally worked out how to deal with
their giant problem. It requires the force of two men per
pike but they surround Wun-Wun and spear him like a woollymammoth. Wun-Wun fights back but the odds are overwhelming.
It’s only a matter of time now.
The battle is lost.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
Atop his horse, Ramsay takes in the lay of the land:
The pile of the dead. The Stark forces enclosed by the body
pile and the Bolton infantry. A tightening circle of flesh
and steel that will inevitably kill the Stark forces.
Ramsay has a moment of deep contentment.
And his contentment turns to confusion as a war horn sounds
in the distance.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - TORMUND MOMENT
The war horn sounds again, and Smalljon makes the mistake of
looking to its source. The instant of distraction is all the
battered Tormund needs to sink his teeth into Smalljon’s ear.
Smalljon roars with pain as Tormund rips his ear off, and
releases his grip on Tormund, who grabs a dagger from his
belt and pops Smalljon’s eyes like eggs.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
The Vale horn sounds again.
Jon sees the source of the war horn:
The VALE CAVALRY is emerging from the woods flying the House
Arryn sigil, two thousand strong, galloping against the glare
of the sun as it rises above the treetops.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT - DAY
Ramsay sees the Vale cavalry riding in to ruin his day.
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 34.
EXT. TREELINE - SANSA/LF MOMENT
High above the battlefield from the safety of the treeline,
two spectators watch from horseback:
Sansa. And LITTLEFINGER.
Below them, the Vale cavalry rushes toward the Bolton flank.
We see all this from above, through the magic of VFX:
The Bolton circle dissolves as if by centrifugal force as the
Vale cavalry approaches.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
Ramsay sees all this from his vantage point. He may be
furious, but he is smart: he knows it’s all falling apart.
He turns and looks at Jon, atop the body pile.
A beat where the two glorious bastards glare at each other
from a distance.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
Jon glares at Ramsay.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - RAMSAY MOMENT
Ramsay doesn't sit and wait for checkmate. He whistles to two
remaining generals. He turns to ride for the castle, and his
generals follow.
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - JON MOMENT
Tormund comes up beside Jon on the body pile, with Wun-Wun
behind him. In the background the Vale make short work of the
already weary Bolton army.
Together, they see Ramsay getting away.
EXT. TREELINE - SANSA/LF MOMENT
From Sansa’s high and wide perspective, we see Jon, Tormund
and Wun-Wun tearing after Ramsay, with Wun-Wun in the lead.
But Ramsay will get to Winterfell first.
Even from this distance, Sansa knows who she’s watching. The
situation does not look good to her.
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 35.
EXT. WINTERFELL COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
A reserve force of Bolton men has remained in Winterfell, and
three of these close the gate behind Ramsay.
BOLTON ARCHERS man the walls.
Ramsay makes the best of the situation, speaking to his
general as he dismounts. A SQUIRE takes his horse’s reins and
leads it away, just beyond the courtyard arch.
RAMSAY
Their army is gone.
BOLTON GENERAL
Our army is gone.
RAMSAY
We have Winterfell. They don’t have
the men for a siege. All we have to
do is wait.
Some commotion on the walls draws Ramsay’s attention. A few
archers start firing.
A loud boom, as something hits the gate.
The archers manning the battlements over the gate signal for
the archers in other positions to come and help them.
Boom. Boom. Boom.
BOOM. The first hole appears in the gate, made by Wun-Wun’s
cinderblock fist.
Seeing the giant’s fist, Ramsay understands.
All the archers have come around to the battlements
overlooking the main gate, firing down at the giant.
Still the hammering continues, as Wun-Wun batters down the
gate, splintering its ancient wood.
EXT. WINTERFELL COURTYARD - DAY
Ramsay backs away, leaving his increasingly terrified
soldiers to defend the gates alone.
Up on the battlements the archers rain arrows down on the
unseen giant beyond the wall. We hear Wun-Wun roar and the
huge gates rattle with every impact.
More holes appear. Wun-Wun is breaking through; we see his
bloody face through the shattered boards. There’s not much
fight left in him, but he spends it all here.
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 36.
He starts smashing into the compromised gate with his
shoulder. Smash, smash, smash.
Archers in the courtyard shoot at Wun-Wun through the holes
in the door.
Wun-Wun howls and his siege stops abruptly. Silence follows.
Is it over? Yells from the archers above suggest the
contrary.
A series of thunderous footsteps and Wun-Wun finally comes
crashing through the gate into the courtyard, covered in so
many arrows he looks like a porcupine. Wun-Wun falls to his
knees, his blood seeping into the dust.
Wildling archers and Northern infantrymen stream in around
him. The Bolton archers have no more cover and the wildlings
are great shots. Bolton archers get a few Stark loyalists,
including a hapless MORMONT INFANTRYMAN but the Bolton
archers are not long for this world.
Tormund and Jon enter the courtyard.
As the wildlings clean up the Bolton archers, Tormund and Jon
go to Wun-Wun, who is gasping, his lungs penetrated by
arrows.
And from the far end of the courtyard, an arrow drills deep
into Wun-Wun’s eye, a foot from Jon’s face.
Wun-Wun collapses to the dirt.
Jon and Tormund look to the source of the kill shot:
Ramsay Bolton, standing beneath the archway with its defaced
direwolf relief. Bow in hand, quiver on his back.
Jon is wounded, exhausted. Only hate keeps him standing.
RAMSAY
You suggested one-on-one combat,
didn’t you? I’ve reconsidered. I
think that sounds like a wonderful
idea.
Jon takes an unsteady step toward Ramsay. Tormund speaks low:
TORMUND
Don’t.
Jon doesn’t hear him, or doesn’t listen. He stoops to pick up
the Mormont man’s shield, and walks toward Ramsay.
Ramsay pulls and arrow, nocks, draws and shoots.
Jon catches the arrow with his shield. He lowers the shield
and keeps walking, and gains focus as he goes.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 37.
Ramsay pulls another arrow, more hurried this time. He nocks, draws, shoots.
Jon blocks; the arrow punches through the shield, its point
an inch from Jon's face.
Jon keeps walking.
Ramsay is frantic now. He pulls the arrow. He fumbles the
nock. He draws the bowstring--
And Jon’s shield catches him upside the head, sending his
shot wide and dropping him.
Jon stands over Ramsay and beats down on him with the shield,
opening his forehead, breaking his nose, and his ribs.
Ramsay makes a feeble attempt to rise, but Jon is on top of
him before he can, pummeling his head with fists and
forearms. He has every intention of methodically beating
Ramsay to death.
But Sansa, Littlefinger and Davos arrive through the broken
gate. Hearing their horses, Jon turns to see them.
He doesn’t care about Davos or Littlefinger in this moment.
He only looks at Sansa.
She looks back at him, and at Ramsay.
Jon realizes that Ramsay is not his to kill.
He climbs off Ramsay, whose face is now a bloody mess, and
rises to his feet.
Ramsay looks up at the blurry, silhouetted form of Jon,
breathing heavily from the exertion of the beating, staring
down at him.
Jon walks away, as Ramsay blacks out.
EXT. WINTERFELL - DAY - LATER
The Flayed Man banners come down. The Stark wolf's head flies
over Winterfell once again.
Melisandre watches it happen from the covered walkway where
Ned Stark once stood. Her prophecy, fulfilled. If only she'd
been able to see the truth of it earlier.
Jon, the king she was meant to serve, confers with Tormund in
the courtyard.
On ground level, some STARK MEN bring in Rickon's body. Sansa
is with them.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 38.
Jon steps over to Sansa and together they look at their dead
brother.
EXT. WINTERFELL ARCHWAY
In the shadows of the archway, Davos watches Melisandre go.
He’s sitting on a truth so horrible he can barely bring
himself to believe it. But he has the evidence in his hand:
the charred wooden stag. He grips it tight, and walks away
himself.
EXT. WINTERFELL COURTYARD
Jon turns to his men:
JON
We’re going to bury my brother in
the crypt, next to my father.
They watch the men take Rickon's body away.
Sansa turns to Jon. Her mind is not on Rickon anymore.
SANSA
Where is he?
INT. KENNELS - NIGHT
We’re very close on Ramsay as he sits in the dark, his
battered head lolling on his neck, covered in blood from his
recent beating. We're tight enough and the room is dark
enough that we can't tell where we are yet.
We widen out enough to see that he is strapped to a chair,
tightly.
He comes to, opens his eyes. An image comes slowly into
focus:
Sansa, standing several yards away, watching him behind a
locked gate. She is lit by a single torch in a wall sconce
beside her.
RAMSAY
Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa.
His dogs whine in response to the sound of his voice, but we
don’t see them yet. We stay on Ramsay; in a painful daze, he
realizes where he is: in the center of the kennel.
He doesn’t pay the dogs any mind for the moment. He focuses
on Sansa as best he can.
RAMSAY
Is this where I’ll be staying now?
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 39.
Sansa does not react or respond. She just watches him.
RAMSAY
No. Our time together is about to
come to an end.
(beat)
That’s all right. You can’t kill
me. I’m a part of you now.
Sansa still says nothing.
His attempts to break her composure are a failure. She speaks
with the calm of total certainty.
SANSA
Your words will disappear. Your
house will disappear, your name
will disappear. All memory of you
will disappear.
We’re looking at Ramsay head-on. As his own certainty gives
way to doubt, we come around to his profile, and see one of
his hounds sitting in his cage, watching Ramsay.
The kennel door is wide open.
Ramsay smiles at Sansa.
RAMSAY
My hounds will never harm me.
SANSA
You haven’t fed them in seven days.
You said it yourself.
All the kennel cages are open. Nine lean dogs crouch low and
smiling, licking their chops, sniffing the air.
RAMSAY
They’re loyal beasts.
SANSA
They were. Now they’re starving.
The blood on Ramsay’s face has not dried yet, not entirely.
Some of it still glistens in the dim firelight.
The dog closest to Ramsay stands, pads from his cage and
begins sniffing at his former master’s bloody hands.
RAMSAY
Sit.
The dog does the opposite: he raises himself up on Ramsay’s
chair and starts sniffing at his face.
RAMSAY
Down.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES BATTLE OF THE BASTARDS 40.
From deeper in the kennel, another dog emerges, and another.
RAMSAY
Down.
The dog on Ramsay licks some of the blood from Ramsay’s face.
It tastes better than anything the dog has ever tasted;
saliva drips from his chops.
RAMSAY
Get down!
We move to a vantage deeper in the kennel, behind Ramsay, his
back to us, the dog facing camera. We move toward Ramsay as
the hound begins to lick his face with more and more ardor.
RAMSAY
No. No no no no, down down down...
We get closer to Ramsay. The hound is switching over. His
lips draw back over his teeth. Low growl in his throat.
Other dogs trot from their open kennels, moving past the
camera toward their long-awaited supper.
We move alongside Ramsay and the dog to pass them; they slide
toward the edge of frame. We begin to lose focus on them just
as the animal lunges and digs his teeth into Ramsay’s face,
and Ramsay screams...
And then we’re past him, pushing toward Sansa.
Once she knows the end is nigh, she turns and walks away. We
come around to stay with her face as she walks away, her head
and body blocking our view of the carnage behind her.
Ramsay screams. His screams become wet wheezes as the dogs go
to work on his throat. And through it all, we stay on Sansa,
as she walks away from him forever, allowing herself the
faintest possible smile.

GAME OF THRONES "The Iron Throne" 1.
EXT. KING'S LANDING MAIN GATES - DAY
Snow has begun to fall and will continue to fall throughout
this day.
King's Landing is a smoldering wreck of a city.
TYRION LANNISTER steels himself and heads inside the ruined
capital. We follow him Son of Saul style, tight on his face
as he passes through the gates. Where the main gate once
stood there is only melted steel and crumbled stone.
There is no score to soften the horror. Aside from a few
distant shouts and screams, the broken city is eerily quiet.
Much of the victorious army is behind him, but we’ll only see
them incidentally as he passes through the gates with a small
honor guard. Smoke, shallow focus.
JON SNOW and DAVOS SEAWORTH follow him with a small group of
NORTHMEN at their backs, but we stay with Tyrion’s
perspective for the whole of this opening sequence: on his
back, on his face.
On the periphery of the frame, scorched bodies lie on the
sides of the main street where they fell. Tyrion sees them
(and Jon and Davos behind him), but they keep walking.
People baked in their brick home as if in an oven. And a
child sitting out front, crying, alone.
Another dead child, face down on the ground.
A NORTHERN SOLDIER sits on a pile of rubble in front of a
stairwell, weeping amongst the wreckage.
Human silhouettes on the dragon-scorched ground where the
ashes have blown away, the negative image of the Hiroshima
silhouettes.
A WALKING WOUNDED MAN passes without acknowledging Tyrion and
his party. As if he does not even see them.
A small, charred hand pokes out from underneath the rubble,
holding a tin horse. The same little girl Arya tried to help
in 805.
They all stop to look at what remains of the dead little
girl.
Tyrion glances at Jon.
TYRION
I’ll find you later.
JON
Let me send some of my men with
you.

Jon gestures to his men to go with Tyrion, but:
TYRION
I’m going alone.
Tyrion stares at Jon for a beat. He outranks everyone here. Jon finally nods and steps aside.
Jon watches him walk through an archway framing the
devastation beyond. We tilt up to reveal the distant Red
Keep.
EXT. KING'S LANDING ALLEY - DAY
Jon, Davos and the Northmen come across GREY WORM and a
platoon of Unsullied standing over a group of LANNISTER
OFFICERS on their knees.
GREY WORM
In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you
to die.
JON
Grey Worm!
Grey Worm turns and watches Jon approach. He seems neither
surprised nor pleased to see his queen’s lover.
JON
It’s over. These men are prisoners.
GREY WORM
It is not over until the queen’s
enemies are defeated.
DAVOS
(incredulous)
How much more defeated do you want
them to be? They’re on their knees!
GREY WORM
They are breathing.
DAVOS
Look around you, friend. We won.
GREY WORM
I follow my queen’s commands. Not
yours.
JON
And what are the queen’s commands?
GREY WORM “Kill all those who follow Cersei
Lannister.”

Grey Worm draws his knife.
GREY WORM
These are free men. They chose to
fight for her.
As Grey Worm steps behind the first officer in the line, Jon
grabs his arm.
A dozen Unsullied level their spears at Jon.
The Northmen behind Jon draw their swords, prepared to defend
their commander.
DAVOS
Easy, men! Easy!
Grey Worm pulls his arm free and stares at Jon. He is quite
ready to fight the Northerner if further provoked.
Jon stares back, but unlike Grey Worm he is plagued with
doubt. These men are his allies. How did it come to this?
DAVOS
(to Jon)
We should speak to the Queen.
Jon hates to walk away from what he considers an injustice, but the only other choice is even greater bloodshed.
He walks away, turning once to see Grey Worm cut the first
officer’s throat.
INT. MAP ROOM - DAY
Tyrion walks past the ruined map room, snow starting to cover
the ash and rubble.
INT. SMALL COUNCIL ROOM - DAY
He walks past the table where he and Cersei often fought,
past the little office where he and his father often fought.
He grabs an unlit torch from a sconce. He's heading into the
darkness.
INT. TUNNELS- DAY
Alone and carrying a lit torch, Tyrion makes his way down a
staircase into the secret underbelly of the Red Keep.
At the end of the dark tunnel he comes upon a great mound of
rubble, blocking his passage. He raises his torch and sees a
small gap at the very top of the rubble. It is lighter on the
other side than it is here.

He puts down the torch and starts climbing up the rubble.
INT. DRAGON SKULL ROOM - DAY
Tyrion walks through what's left of the dragon skull room, toward the light provided by the hole that Drogon blasted in
the ceiling.
Many of the skulls have been crushed by falling rock; even
Balerion the Dread's skull has been caved in. All of the
skulls have been blackened and scorched by the extreme heat
of the fires that raged for hours.
And then he sees it, in the pile of rubble and ash made by
Drogon’s blast:
A hint of a golden hand.
Tyrion gets down on his knees and clears the rubble and ash
away.
It’s hard, filthy work. Tyrion starts to cry midway through
but doesn’t stop until he’s cleared away the remains of Jaime
and Cersei.
They are still in each other's arms: his golden hand resting
beside her head; her lion pendant still encircling her neck.
Tyrion sits beside the remains of his brother and sister and
cries for them both.
EXT. RED KEEP FRONT GATES (AEGON'S HILL) - DAY
High atop Aegon's Hill, we follow ARYA STARK as she heads
toward the plaza. She passes a group of Unsullied as they
toss dead Lannister bodies in a pile, stacking them like
cordwood.
Reaching the edge of the plaza, she stays on the edge of the
proceedings, observing from a distance.
Targaryen imagery is on display here: the big red and black
dragon banners have been draped over the walls.
Unsullied line both sides of the steps, with Grey Worm
waiting up top. All the remaining Unsullied are in formation
in front of the steps.
Behind them, the Dothraki congregate, some with their horses, some on foot.
And behind the Dothraki, at the main entrance to the plaza, opposite the steps, Jon enters into the space. Arya sees him.

We go to Jon as he looks across the crowd to the staircase
and the wrecked facade that frames the top of it. The wrecked
Red Keep visible in the distance.
We follow Jon as he makes his way through the Dothraki, then
to the aisle in the Unsullied ranks that leads to the
staircase.
Jon sees Grey Worm standing at the top of the steps, staring
down at him.
They both look up when they hear the heavy beat of dragon
wings.
Drogon flies overhead, over Dothraki waving their arakhs and
Unsullied standing motionless, spears in hand.
Drogon lands out of sight beyond the top of the stairs. Jon
climbs the stairway. When he nears the top he sees Dany, already dismounted, walking towards him. For a moment, Drogon’s unfolding wings spread behind her back, an
unsettling image. Her Satanic Majesty’s Request.
She walks to the edge of the steps and looks out over her
gathered armies, over the demolished city.
First she addresses her Dothraki in their native tongue.
DANY
Qoy qoyi! Shafka vernish ei asqoy
shafki anhaan. Shafka addrivish
dozge anni ma khogaroon shiqethi

(Blood of my blood! You kept all
your promises to me. You killed my
enemies in their iron suits!)
The Dothraki scream and raise their arakhs into the air. We
have some badass-looking Dothraki in the mix.
DANY
Shafka ohharish okrenegwin mori!
(You tore down their stone houses!)
Her khalasar roars.
DANY
Shafka ray azhish anhaan Rhaeshis
Andahli!
(You have given me the Seven
Kingdoms!)
Her Dothraki scream and wave their arakhs.
Jon watches all this, disturbed.
Next Dany addresses her Unsullied in Valyrian, first turning
to Grey Worm.

beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the
most loyal of soldiers. I name you
commander of all my forces, the
Queen’s Master of War.)
Grey Worm bows his head, acknowledging this high honor.
Tyrion approaches from the Red Keep side, looking shaken and
despondent. Jon glances at him.
Tyrion doesn’t look at Jon, or at Dany’s gathered forces. He
is trapped inside his own head, thinking about what he just
saw.
Dany turns to the Unsullied foot soldiers standing down in
the plaza.

(Unsullied! All of you were torn

The Unsullied slam their spear butts onto the ground, three
times in perfect synch, affirming their pride in their
achievement and their queen.

From Winterfell to Dorne, from
Lannisport to Qarth, from the
Summer Isles to the Jade Sea, women, men, and children have
suffered too long beneath the
wheel. Will you break the wheel
with me?)
The Unsullied slam their spear butts onto the ground, again
and again, eager for the fight.
Tyrion, who understands enough Valyrian to get the gist of
what she's saying, looks around the ruined city. If this is
liberation, he doesn't believe in liberation theology.
The Unsullied continue to drum the butts of their spears on
the ground in unison, praising their queen.
Amidst the ashes of her conquest and the corpses of her
enemies, Dany accepts the worship of her followers. The
devastated city stretches out below her, but she shows no
signs of ambivalence or doubt. She has burned the village to
save it.
Arya watches from afar, cool and hooded, appraising Dany and
her forces. Arya hated Cersei as much as anyone. That doesn’t
mean she likes the new boss. To her it looks like the Seven
Kingdoms just traded one tyrant for another.
Dany turns to Tyrion.
We begin to fade down on the drumming spears.
DANY
You freed your brother. You
committed treason.
Tyrion sees no point in arguing his case. He looks around the
ruined city.
He begged her not to do this, and she did it anyway. Hundreds
of thousands have died.
He wanted a bloodless revolution. He would have gladly died
to put her on the throne without the horror they just
witnessed. But he failed.
TYRION
I freed my brother. And you
slaughtered a city.
He steps forward to the edge of the landing, removes his Hand
pin and tosses it down the steps.
The spear butting stops abruptly. Thousands of Dany’s loyal
warriors stare up at this man who dares to disrespect their
queen.

At one point, this betrayal would have hurt Dany deeply. That
point is long gone. She stares at her former Hand with anger, disgusted that she trusted him so deeply for so long.
DANY
Ziry najikatas. (Take him.)
Grey Worm and a posse of Unsullied follow out the order as
Jon watches in disbelief.
Dany walks toward the Red Keep, flanked by a large contingent
of her Dothraki bodyguards.
Jon is so distracted by what he’s just seen that he doesn’t
notice Arya now standing beside him.
Jon looks at her in disbelief.
JON
What are you doing here?
ARYA
I came to kill Cersei. Your queen
got there first.
JON
She’s everyone’s queen, now.
Arya’s expression is noncommittal.
ARYA
Try telling Sansa.
Jon needs to go deal with matters, now.
JON
Wait for me outside the city. I’ll
find you.
Before he can take a step, Arya grabs his arm and looks up at
him.
ARYA
Jon.
No one else is close enough to hear their words.
ARYA
She knows who you are. Who you
really are. You’ll always be a
threat to her.
Arya looks to Dany, walking away with her Dothraki bodyguard.
ARYA
And I know a killer when I see one.

INT. MAKESHIFT CELL - DAY
The Unsullied have found a makeshift cell for Tyrion
somewhere on the Red Keep grounds. Perhaps it's one of the
few intact chambers.
Tyrion sits with his back against the wall, staring up at the
weak light.
We hear the bolt slide and the door opens: Jon Snow stands
there. He nods to the Unsullied sentries and steps inside.
One of the sentries closes the door after him and we hear the
bolt slide.
TYRION
Did you bring any wine?
JON
No.
TYRION
(disappointed)
Ah. Well, thank you for coming to
see me. (beat)
Our queen doesn’t keep prisoners
for long.
JON
No.
TYRION
I suppose there’s a crude kind of
justice. I betrayed my closest
friend and watched him burn. Now
Varys’ ashes can tell my ashes,
“See! I told you.”
Jon is unable to see the humor in the situation.
TYRION
It just occurred to me: I’m talking
to the only man alive who knows
where I’m going. So? Is there life
after death?
JON
Not that I’ve seen.
Tyrion takes this with his usual fatalism.
TYRION
I should be thankful. Oblivion is
the best I can hope for. I
strangled my lover. I shot my own
father with a crossbow. I betrayed
my queen.

You didn’t--

I did. And I’d do it again, now
that I’ve seen what I’ve seen. (shrugs)
I chose my fate. The people of
King's Landing did not.
Jon cannot argue with this. He's seen too much horror in the
last day. He glances towards the window.
JON
I can’t justify what happened. I
won’t try. But the war is over now.
TYRION
Is it? When you heard her talking
to her soldiers, did she sound like
someone who's done fighting?
Jon doesn’t answer, but his expression makes it clear he
harbors the same worry.
TYRION
She’s a conqueror. She liberated
the people of Slaver's Bay. She
liberated the people of King's
Landing. She'll go on liberating
until all the people of the world
are free... and she rules them all.
JON
And you've been by her side,
counseling her. Until today.
TYRION
Until today.
(beat)
Varys was right. I was wrong. It
was vanity to think I could guide
her. Our queen’s nature is fire and
blood.
JON
(angry)
You think our house words are
stamped on our bodies when we’re
born and that’s who we are? Then
I’d be fire and blood, too. (quieter)
She’s not her father. No more than
you’re Tywin Lannister.

My father was an evil man. My
sister was an evil woman. Pile up
all the bodies of all the people
they ever killed. Throw in Ramsay
Bolton’s victims for good measure. Add them all up, and they still
won’t be half as many as our
beautiful queen slaughtered in a
single day. A million people lived
in this filthy city before we
attacked. How many are living now?
The argument gets more heated, both men impassioned.
JON
Cersei left her no choice--
TYRION
The moment the gates fell the
battle was over. She burned
families alive in their homes.
JON
She saw her best friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the
sky. Your sister betrayed her.
TYRION
And she burnt down a city for it!
JON
It’s easy to judge when you’re
standing far from the battlefield--
TYRION
Would you have done it?
JON
What?
TYRION
You’ve been up there, on a dragon’s
back. You’ve had that power. Would
you have burnt the city down?
JON
I don’t know.

Tyrion looks up at Jon. It’s important that Jon listens and
Tyrion makes sure he is before beginning his argument.
TYRION
When she murdered the slavers of
Astapor, I’m sure no one but the
slavers complained. After all, they
were evil men. When she crucified
hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who
could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burnt alive?
They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die
and we cheer her for it. And she
grows more powerful, and more sure
that she is Good and Right. (beat)
She believes her destiny is to
build a better world, for everyone. To fix what is broken for every
man, woman and child. If you
believed that, if you truly
believed it... wouldn’t you kill
whoever stands between you and
paradise?
The two men are silent for a moment.
TYRION
I know you love her. I love her,
too. Not as successfully as you.
But I believed in her with all my
heart.
(beat)
Love is more powerful than reason.
We all know that. Look at my
brother.
Jon remembers what Aemon told him so many years ago.
JON
“Love is the death of duty.”
The words surprise Tyrion.
TYRION
You just came up with that?

He lets Jon think about that for a moment.
Tyrion looks old and weary as he admits the great failure of
his life.
TYRION
You won’t be able to hold her in
check. You won’t be able to guide
her. I thought I could. I thought
she’d listen to me. I was wrong. (beat)
You’re the last hope.
Jon realizes that Tyrion is overtly asking him to turn on
Dany.
JON
I love her.
TYRION
I know. (beat)
It’s a terrible thing I’m asking. It’s also the right thing.
(beat)
You think I’m the last man she’ll
execute? If you don’t stop her,
everyone who stands against her
will share my fate. And who is more
dangerous than the rightful heir to
the Iron Throne?
Jon shakes his head. He’s long past caring about himself or
his personal safety.
JON
If that’s her decision... she’s the
queen.
He looks around the cell.
JON
I’m sorry it came to this.
He knocks on the door of the cell and waits for the Unsullied
to come get him.

Jon turns to look at Tyrion. He doesn’t care about his own
skin but his sisters -- that’s a very different matter.
TYRION
They’re both as stubborn as their
mother ever was. Do you see them
bending the knee? Sansa swearing
eternal loyalty to a queen she
neither likes nor trusts?
Jon’s response is neither convinced nor convincing:
JON
My sisters will be loyal to the
Throne.
We hear the footsteps of the Unsullied approaching the cell.
TYRION
Why do you think Sansa told me the
truth about you? Because she
doesn’t want Dany to be queen--
JON
She doesn’t get to choose!
TYRION
No. But you do. (beat)
And you have to choose now.
We hear the bolt slide and the door opens.
Jon stares at Tyrion for a beat and walks out.
The door shuts. The bolt slides. And Tyrion waits.
EXT. RED KEEP - RUINS - DAY
Jon walks through the ruins of the Red Keep.
The approach to the throne room is lined with Unsullied,
dozens of them. None of them stop Jon. They all know who he
is, and what he means to their queen.
The red-and-black Targaryen banners hang at regular
intervals.

Jon looks up at the wreckage, then down to the entryway; it
looks a bit like the frontage of a cathedral wrecked in the
Blitz, surrounded by monumental chunks of fire-blackened
masonry. But the doors are intact.
Jon steps forward, but stops.
Amidst the mountains of black rubble, Drogon lies next to the
entrance, cleaning his claws with his long tongue.
He’s been hidden in plain sight for much of this time, his
dusty black scales almost a part of the rubble.
Jon takes a deep breath and heads for the doors.
Drogon sees him. He lifts his head, blocking the way.
The massive dragon stares at the diminutive man, studying him
with eyes that seem just as intelligent as Jon's own.
For a long, tense beat, Drogon considers this suitor for his
mother's attentions.
His head comes in close. He takes a big sniff.
Jon is a friend, not a threat. Drogon’s head snakes away, back to his claws to resume his cleaning.
Jon walks past the dragon and into the keep.
INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY
Dany stands in the Throne Room. It looks just like it did in
her vision, only the area behind the Iron Throne has been
destroyed altogether. I.e., no window behind throne,
Lannister or otherwise.
The snow falls lightly through the collapsed roof as she
steps past the pillars, down the central aisle. Rubble from
the fallen roof is visible on the floor, covered in a layer
of snow.
For a few seconds, the conquering queen disappears and she
looks like a young girl again, entranced by the beauty of the
moment, and the object of her greatest desire.
It is right there. The reason for her long journey across two
continents, the endless conflicts, the deaths of her loved
ones:
The Iron Throne.
She slowly climbs the snow-covered stairs.
She reaches out to touch it, and hesitates. Perhaps she
remembers the vision in which the throne was a temptation to
avoid.

But this isn’t a vision. This is real. She touches the arm of
the throne, resting her hand on the cold metal where so many
of her ancestors’ hands rested for so many centuries.
She is standing directly in front of it. All she has to do is
sit and the journey is complete.
She turns to sit. In doing so, she sees Jon enter the throne
room.
The throne can wait. She steps down to meet him on the floor
in front of the throne platform.
Dany is at ease for the first time in as long as we can
remember. Maybe the first time ever. She has won.
She looks back at the throne.
DANY
When I was a girl, my brother told
me it was made with a thousand
swords from Aegon’s fallen enemies.
She smiles at the memory as she turns back to Jon.
DANY
What do a thousand swords look like
in the mind of a little girl who
can’t count to twenty? I imagined a
mountain of swords too high to
climb. So many fallen enemies you
could only see the soles of Aegon’s
feet.
(beat)
But many years later, I saw it. The
real thing.
JON
How?
DANY
In a vision. The roof, the snow,
the throne...

It all looked exactly like this.
In this room, at this very moment, the sense of Dany’s
destiny is pervasive. Shattering its spell is difficult. But
Jon does, because he has to.
JON
I saw them executing Lannister
prisoners in the street. They said
they were acting on your orders.
She can see that Jon is deeply troubled. She does not
condescend. On the contrary, she loves him for it.

Forgive him.
DANY
I can’t.
JON
You can. You can forgive all of
them. Make them see that they made
a mistake. Make them understand.
Looking at her, his need to believe is almost overwhelming.
JON
Please, Dany.
She considers his plea for clemency for a long moment. But
she cannot grant it.

eyes closed, his hand behind her head, her hand on his cheek.
Dany’s eyes open suddenly as she draws a sharp breath.
Jon’s eyes open as well, already filling with tears. For a
moment, neither moves, as if moving will make this real.
In a wider angle, we see Jon with his hand still on the hilt
of the dagger he just lodged in Dany’s heart.
Her strength leaves her and she collapses to the marble; he
keeps her in his arms as she falls, kneeling down to the
floor beside her.
He looks down at what he’s done. Terrible. And necessary. He
hopes for one last moment with her.
But her eyes are already glazing over. Winter has come to the
Throne Room. Dany lies dead in his arms, Pieta-style, as the
snow drifts down.
Jon buries his head next to hers and cries.
His mourning is brought to an end by the sound of beating
wings, coming closer, and a great roar.
Jon looks to the place the ceiling used to be, and sees
Drogon wheeling in the sky, heading for the Throne Room.
Drogon lands before him, shaking the throne room’s
foundations. His wings fall to his side, displacing enough
air that Jon has to steel himself against the gust.
Jon doesn't flee. He has no interest in avoiding death; he
has nothing left to live for. He stands and steps away from
Dany’s body.
Drogon moves his head close to Dany’s body. He sniffs at her. He nudges her gently.

Drogon’s huge brow lowers and his pupils dilate as the worst
is confirmed. His lips raise over teeth as long as short
swords.
The dragon rises up on his hind legs, towering over Jon.
In a beautiful, terrifying tableaux, he roars to the sky, the
embodiment of rage.
He looks down at Jon. We see the fire build up in his throat.
Jon sees it as well. He prepares to die.
But the blast is not for him. Drogon wants to burn the world
but he will not kill Jon.
He breathes fire on the back wall, blasting down what remains
of the great red blocks of stone.
We look over Jon’s shoulder as the fire sweeps toward the
throne-- not the target of Drogon’s wrath, just a dumb
bystander caught up in the conflagration.
We look through the blades of the throne as the flames engulf
it, and blast the wall behind it.
We see the throne in the flames, turning red, then white, then beginning to lose its form.
We get tight shots of the details melting in silhouette: the
armrests, the iconic fan of swords on the backrest.
The fire stops. The smoke clears revealing a puddle of
smouldering slag where the throne once stood.
Who will sit on the Iron Throne? No one.
Drogon turns back to Dany’s lifeless body and delicately
gathers her up with a claw.
With heavy thrusts of his wings, Drogon takes to the air, and
flies away through the missing roof.
Jon watches him recede, with his mother’s corpse in his
grasp.
EXT. SKY OVER KING'S LANDING - DAY
We follow Drogon over the ruined city with Dany's lifeless
body clutched in his claw.
He heads out toward the eastern sky, flying over Blackwater
Bay. It’s not a dusky beauty shot; it’s gray and lifeless, as
befits a funeral.
We fade to black.

INT. TYRION’S CELL - DAY
Tyrion is in a proper cell now, as befits a condemned man. The intervening weeks have been hard ones; he hasn’t slept, bathed or eaten well in a long time. His beard is longer, his
hair matted down and filthy.
He sits on the ground in the half light and thinks about the
enormity of all that has happened, and his role in it.
He has no plans, no wants, no desire to effect change or
avoid suffering.
He failed. He is finished.
The bolt slides and the door opens. Grey Worm has come for
him, with four Unsullied. He does not tell Tyrion where he is
going, and Tyrion does not ask.
INT. RED KEEP CORRIDORS - DAY
Grey Worm leads a manacled Tyrion down Red Keep corridors
with the Unsullied behind them. Is Tyrion heading to his own
death? He’ll find out soon enough.
Tyrion walks toward us.
EXT. DRAGON PIT ENTRY TUNNEL - DAY
In the entryway to the Dragonpit, Tyrion walks between two
lines of Unsullied with Grey Worm still at his side.
[The number of Unsullied has grown, to about 20.]
Tyrion looks at the crumbled walls rising up on either side
of him, still patched with snow on the top.
The landscape is showing signs of a thaw. Weeks have passed
since the day of Dany’s assassination.
Tyrion looks to Grey Worm, who stares straight ahead.
Tyrion faces forward as they emerge into the Dragonpit.
EXT. DRAGON PIT - CONTINUOUS
The most powerful lords and ladies of Westeros are here, representing all Seven Kingdoms, sitting in similar
circumstances to the summit meeting in 707, though arrayed in
a semicircle.
When they see Tyrion and the Unsullied, they all stand. The
tension is palpable.

GAME OF THRONES "The Iron Throne" 22.
Present are: The Lady of Winterfell and Wardenness of the
North, SANSA STARK, who sits in the middle of the semicircle. Arya and BRAN STARK sit to her right. To her left: the Onion
Knight, Davos.
The Lord of the Vale and Warden of the East, ROBIN ARRYN, with LORD ROYCE beside him.
The Lady of the Iron Islands, YARA GREYJOY. The Lord of the
Stormlands and Warden of the South, GENDRY BARATHEON. The
lord of the Riverlands, EDMURE TULLY. The new PRINCE OF
DORNE.
BRIENNE OF TARTH. SAMWELL TARLY. A smattering of ND lords.
And behind them all, and on either side, lining the walls of
the Dragonpit: sixty Unsullied. A show of force that leaves
no doubt as to who controls King’s Landing.
Grey Worm leads Tyrion up onto the platform.
For a moment there is silence.
Tyrion and Sansa look at each other for a beat before Sansa
sits. The other lords follow suit. She turns to Grey Worm.
SANSA
Where is Jon?
GREY WORM
We have him. He is our prisoner.
SANSA
So is Lord Tyrion. They were both
to be brought to this gathering.
GREY WORM
We will decide what we do with our
prisoners. This is our city now.
SANSA
If you look outside the walls of
your city, you’ll find thousands of
Northmen who will explain to you
why harming Jon Snow is not in your
interest.
GREY WORM
And you will find thousands of
Unsullied who believe that it is.
Some murmurs of support. And some dissent. Yara stands:
YARA
Some of you may be quick to
forgive. The Ironborn are not. I
swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.

Snow put a knife in her heart. Let
the Unsullied give him what he
deserves.
ARYA
Say another word about killing my
brother and I’ll cut your throat.
Yara opens her mouth to respond but sees the look on Arya’s
face. Yara is as tough as they come, but Arya-- Arya’s
different.
She sits as Davos stands.
DAVOS
Friends. Please. We’ve been cutting
each other’s throats long enough. (to Grey Worm)
Torgo Nudho... am I saying that
properly?
Grey Worm just stares back at him, giving him nothing.
DAVOS
If it weren’t for you and your men, we would have lost the war with the
dead. This country owes you a debt
we can never repay.
(beat)
But let us try.
He looks to the men and women around him, then proceeds with
the proposition they’ve discussed.
DAVOS
There’s land in the Reach, good
land. The people who used to live
there are gone. Make it your own.
Start your own House, with the
Unsullied as your bannermen.
(beat)
We’ve had enough war. Thousands of
you, thousands of them... you know
how it ends. We need to find a
better way.
GREY WORM
We do not need payment. We need
justice. All of us who owe our
lives and freedom to Daenerys
Stormborn need justice.

TYRION
It’s not for you to decide.
These are the first words Tyrion has spoken. Everyone turns
to look at him.
GREY WORM
You are not here to speak. Everyone
has heard enough words from you.
TYRION
You’re right. And no one’s any the
better for it. (beat)
But it’s not for you to decide.
Sansa is pleased, until he turns to her:
TYRION
And it’s not for you to decide, either.
SANSA
Who, then?
TYRION
The rightful ruler of Westeros. Jon
Snow committed his crime here. His
fate is for our king to decide. Or
our queen.
ROYCE
We don’t have a king or queen.
Tyrion’s gaze passes over the assembled lords and ladies.
TYRION
You’re the most powerful people in
Westeros. Choose one.
Tyrion looks up at his keeper, Grey Worm.
Grey Worm does not trust anything Tyrion says or does. But he
looks to the lords and ladies.
GREY WORM
Make your choice, then.
Everyone looks at everyone else. This is not what they came
here to do. But they don’t appear to have any better options.
Edmure stands proudly.

My lords and ladies. I suppose this

reverberate through the annals of
history. I stand before you as one
of the senior lords in the country, a veteran of two wars. I’d like to
think my experience has led to some
small skill in statecraft andSANSA
Uncle.
Edmure is a little annoyed to be cut off in mid-flow, especially by his niece.
SANSA
Please sit.
Edmure can't quite believe what he's seeing, but the chuckles
and suppressed grins of the other lords make him realize that
his newborn hopes of being king were just squashed by a girl.
He sits.
A tense silence as various lords and ladies glance around the
circle, wondering who will vie for power next.
ROYCE
We have to choose someone.
SAMWELL
Why just us?
Everyone looks at Samwell. He stands uncomfortably, steels
himself and soldiers on.
SAMWELL
We represent all the great houses.
But whomever we choose, they won’t
just rule over lords and ladies.
Maybe the decision about what's
best for everyone should be left
to... well, everyone.
The attending lords and ladies stare at him for an
incredulous moment before breaking out into laughter.
EDMURE
Maybe we should give the dogs a
vote as well.

TYRION
Me? The Imp? Half the people hate
me for serving Daenerys. The other
half hate me for betraying her. I
can’t think of a worse choice.
DAVOS
Who, then?
Tyrion has no immediate answer.
No one else does, either.
Grey Worm grows impatient.
TYRION
I’ve had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks. About our
bloody history. About the mistakes
we’ve made.
He looks from face to face.
TYRION
What unites people? Armies? Gold?
Flags?
(shaking his head)
Stories. There is nothing in the
world more powerful than a good
story. Nothing can stop it, no
enemy can defeat it.
(beat)
And who has a better story than
Bran the Broken?
With astonishment, all the gathered lords turn to look at
Bran, sitting in his wheelchair.
Sansa and Arya look more shocked than anyone.
Bran doesn’t look shocked. Simply uninterested. But that
doesn’t bother Tyrion.
TYRION
The boy who fell from a high tower
and lived. He knew he’d never walk
again. So he learned to fly.
All of the gathered lords and ladies study Bran as Tyrion
speaks.

and massacres and famines. Our
triumphs. Our defeats. Our past. (beat)
Who better to lead us into the
future?
As Tyrion speaks, Bran looks down at the armrest of his
wheelchair. A tiny pill bug crawls along the wood.
SANSA
Bran has no interest in ruling. And
he can’t father children.
Bran puts his hand down and lets the bug crawl into his palm.
TYRION
Good. He’ll never thrust his awful
spawn upon us to rule after he
dies.
Tyrion looks up at Grey Worm, still standing next to him.
TYRION
That is the wheel our queen wanted
to break.
As much as Grey Worm hates it, he knows Tyrion is at least
partly right.
TYRION
From now on, when a monarch dies,
the lords of Westeros can gather on
this spot and pick the next one,
just as we’re doing now.
Nods all around display general consensus on this notion.
Tyrion looks at Bran.
TYRION
I know you don’t want it. I know
you don’t care about power. But I
ask you now: if we choose you, will
you wear the crown? Will you lead
the Seven Kingdoms, to the best of
your abilities, from this day until
your last day?
Bran sets his hand back on the arm rest and lets the pill bug
crawl off and resume his journey.

Finally Bran looks around, at all the important people
waiting to hear his decision. He looks at Tyrion.
Bran doesn’t really smile anymore but there is the smallest
hint of amusement on his face as he answers.
BRAN
Why do you think I came all this
way?
A strange response but Tyrion has come to expect strange
answers from Bran.
TYRION
To Brandon of House Stark, first of
his name, I say: Aye.
Tyrion looks around the circle.
Edmure is still be miffed he wasn't given serious
consideration, but he expects he'll have influence at court
if his crippled nephew is ruling.
EDMURE
Aye.
Gendry is happy to go along.
GENDRY
Aye.
Yara has heard that her brother died defending Bran. She
knows this choice would make Theon happy.
YARA
Aye.
Brienne is a Stark loyalist and represents House Tarth.
BRIENNE
Aye.
DAVOS
I’m not sure I get a vote. But aye.
One by one, the lords of Westeros express their support for
Bran. Tyrion is very pleased.
Finally, it comes to Sansa. She does not address Tyrion. She
turns and speaks directly to Bran.
SANSA
I love you, little brother. I
always will. You’ll be a good king. (beat)
But tens of thousands of Northmen
fell in the Great War, defending

Arya smiles.
Tyrion is stunned but also a little impressed. He looks to
Bran.
Everyone in attendance, the most powerful men and women in
Westeros, they all look to their new king, eager to see how
he handles the first crisis of his reign.
Bran watches Sansa for a beat. He nods.
Tyrion looks around for objections or further secessions. Yara? Gendry? Edmure?
None of them speak.
TYRION
All hail Bran the Broken, First of
his Name, King of the Andals and
the First Men, Lord of the Six
Kingdoms, and Protector of the
Realm.
All stand and shout Bran’s name:
ALL
All hail Bran the Broken!
For the first time in a long time, Tyrion dares to feel a
tiny bit good about something. Until:
BRAN
Lord Tyrion. You will be my Hand.
Tyrion truly hates this suggestion.
TYRION
No, your grace. I don’t want it.
BRAN
And I don’t want to be king.

Grey Worm pulls a still-manacled Tyrion closer.
GREY WORM
This man is a criminal. He deserves
justice.
BRAN
He just got it. He’s made many
terrible mistakes. He’s going to
spend the rest of his life fixing
them.
Grey Worm is not sold. He looks right at Bran.
GREY WORM
It is not enough.
Tyrion looks to Bran as well. His life depends on the new
king’s response to this impasse.

Jon looks ragged. He hasn’t slept, hasn’t eaten, hasn’t
bathed. He looks like a man who doesn’t care whether he lives

Tyrion has been explaining the outcome of the kingsmoot to
Jon, who barely seems to listen.
TYRION
Giving you to the Unsullied for
execution would start a war.
Letting you walk free would start a
war.
Tyrion waits but Jon doesn’t look at him.

EXT. RED KEEP BATTLEMENT - DAY
Jon exits the tower that once was his prison.
Two NIGHT’S WATCHMEN wait for him. His escort to his life
sentence at the Wall.
Together, they walk along the battlements.
Jon stops to look down on Blackwater Bay, far beneath him, and sees the remaining ships of Dany’s fleet. Most are
anchored, a few are still sailing in.
From this vantage point, we can see the remaining Unsullied
waiting to board with characteristic orderliness.
The remaining Dothraki do the same; they have dismounted
their horses, and walk them up gangplanks.
EXT. KING'S LANDING - DOCKS - DAY
At sea level now, Jon passes a couple of Dothraki leading
their horses. He looks up to a ship deck and sees Grey Worm. [Jon continues walking, followed by his Night’s Watch
guards.]
They make eye contact. Jon doesn’t say or do anything; he
knows Grey Worm hates him more than any man alive, and he
understands why.
Grey Worm turns away without acknowledging Jon.
EXT. SHIP’S DECK - DAY
Grey Worm walks to the helm. In the background, his men (not
wearing helmets), raise the sails, pull in the gangplank,
etc.
An UNSULLIED CAPTAIN (no helmet) speaks to him in Valyrian.
UNSULLIED CAPTAIN

From behind, we can see the Stark siblings standing on the
distant dock.

Jon stands in front of Sansa. He hasn’t entirely forgiven her
for betraying the oath he made her swear in the godswood.

Jon nods. He knows she loves him. He knows she only wants

He hesitates.
JON
The North is free, thanks to you.
She accepts the compliment.
SANSA
But they’ve lost their true king.
JON
Ned Stark’s daughter will speak for
them. She’s the best they could ask

Jon and Sansa embrace.
Over Sansa’s shoulder, Jon sees Arya crying. She hasn’t cried
in years but she does now, for the brother she always loved
most.
He lets go of Sansa to embrace Arya, and she hugs him
fiercely. He wipes her tears away.

But he misunderstands her:

Hard to argue with omniscience. Jon stands and walks to the

SAILORS are there to row it, accompanied by the two NIGHT’S
WATCHMEN. Jon climbs in.
Together, Sansa, Arya and Bran watch their brother recede, as
he heads toward the ship that will carry him to Eastwatch by
the Sea.
INT. RED KEEP - KINGSGUARD CHAMBER - DAY
The cover of The White Book smacks the table, as Brienne
flips it open.
Wearing her new Kingsguard uniform, Brienne pages through the
book. We see the names on the pages:
Ser Duncan the Tall. Ser Arthur Dayne. Ser Barristan Selmy.
Finally, she finds it: Ser Jaime Lannister.
Jaime’s page is brief and unfinished, as it was the last time
we saw it.
Brienne dips a quill in ink and begins to write, to finish
the rest of Jaime’s story. We watch her face as she does, and
catch snippets of her writing:
...took Riverrun without loss of life... outwitted the
Targaryen forces to seize Highgarden... fought the Army of
the Dead at Winterfell... died protecting his Queen.
Brienne takes a moment to think about a man she both hated
and loved, often at the same time.
Then she collects herself, her duty done. She has somewhere
important to be. She closes The White Book.
INT. SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
Tyrion enters along the colonnade. The council chamber is
empty, as is the map room.
He looks out at the map, his sister’s plan for world
domination, smashed to pieces where the falling masonry hit.
Then he turns and steps into the council chamber. He looks at
the Hand emblem on the chair at the far side of the table. Then down at the same emblem pinned to his chest.

He sits in the Hand’s chair. How the fuck did this happen?
How the fuck did he end up here, alive, with power he no
longer wants or believes he deserves?
He glances around at the other chairs surrounding the table.
Hmm.
He stands up and does some rearranging. He’s not being
theatrical about it like the time he dragged the chair to
annoy Cersei. He just wants everything to be right this time.
Hearing approaching footsteps, he sits done again in the Hand
chair.
The rest of the council arrives: SAMWELL TARLY, BRONN, Davos. He nods at them, and they nod back as they head to their
seats. Davos sits to Tyrion’s left, next to two empty chairs. Across from Davos, Bronn sits next to another two empty
chairs.
Samwell carries a book. He wears the Grandmaester robes and a
chain with a single healing link.
TYRION
What’s this?
Sam drops the book down in front of Tyrion, its title
embossed on its leather cover: A Song of Ice and Fire.
SAMWELL
A Song of Ice and Fire.
Tyrion takes the book in hand.
SAMWELL
Archmaester Ebrose's history of the
wars following the death of King
Robert.
(beat)
I helped him with the title.
Tyrion flips the book open and grins ruefully.
TYRION
I suppose I come in for some heavy
criticism.
SAMWELL
I wouldn’t say that.
Tyrion is surprised and gratified.
TYRION
He’s kind to me? Well. I never

Tyrion pages through the book to verify his absence therein. God dammit!
Hearing approaching footsteps and the squeaking of wheels, Tyrion closes the book.
Brienne and King Bran enter. A Kingsguard pushes Bran, and
two more follow behind them. Brienne wears no helmet, but the
other three do.
Everyone stands as they wheel Bran to the head of the table.

Everyone sits. Brienne sits down next to Bran. He surveys the

We appear to be missing a Master of
Whisperers. And a Master of Laws.
And a Master of War.
TYRION
Yes, your grace. Suitable prospects
will be brought to you for an
audience in the coming weeks.
BRAN
And Drogon? Any word?
SAMWELL
He was last spotted flying east.
BRONN
The farther away the better.
BRAN
Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on
with the rest.
That’s weird. But so is the new king.

BRIENNE
Ser Podrick?
One of the Kingsguard steps forward: PODRICK PAYNE, in a
Kingsguard uniform. He pulls Bran away from the head of the
table, and they all rise.
TYRION
We serve at your pleasure, King
Bran the Broken, Ruler of the Six
Kingdoms and Protector of the
Realm.
With a sloppy lack of unison the group says:
ALL
Long may he reign.
Tyrion smiles apologetically at the young king.
TYRION
That will improve.
Bran smiles slightly and nods.
BRAN
I’m sure it will.
Pod swings him around and pushes him from the room.
Exit Bran. Everyone sits back down.
Looking around the table, Tyrion gets down to business.
TYRION
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord
of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of
the Reach and Master of Coin --
would you say the crown’s debt to
you has been paid?
BRONN
In full, my Lord Hand.
TYRION
Good. Time to start incurring a new
one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in
this regard?
BRONN
Indeed we can.

TYRION
Lord Davos, we have an armada to
rebuild and ports to repair.
DAVOS
We have. (looks at Bronn)
These projects will begin at once, as soon as the Master of Coin and
Lord of Lofty Titles provides
funding.
BRONN
The Master of Coin looks forward to
helping the Master of Ships. But
first he has to insure we’re not
wasting coin, or soon there won’t
be no more coin.
DAVOS
Any more.
BRONN
You Master of Grammar now, too?
Moving on:
TYRION
Grandmaester, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the
Casterly Rock sewers, that clean
water leads to a healthier
population.
Sam agrees and begins to expound.
SAMWELL
I’ve done some research on this
subject [and it turns out]--
Bronn interrupts.
BRONN
The strong live and the weak don't.
TYRION
(ignoring Bronn)
Let’s find the best builders and
set them to the task.
We begin to drift away from the table as these smart, experienced people plan a better future.
BRONN
Speaking of builders... all the
best brothels burned down. The
Master of Coin is willing to fund
reconstruction.

Brienne gives him a disapproving look.
We pull back through the columns, and across the rubble- covered map room.
SAMWELL
Archmaester Ebrose is less than
enthusiastic about the salutary
effects of brothels.
BRONN
I imagine he isn’t using them
properly.
BRIENNE
I think we can all agree that ships
take precedence over brothels.
BRONN
I think that is a very presumptuous
statement.
TYRION
You know, I once brought a jackass
and a honeycomb into a brothel...
EXT. THE WALL/CASTLE BLACK - DAY
Spring is coming, and it is slowly starting to warm up.
The Wall weeps, as the temperature rises above freezing for
the first time in many months.
Looking down the Wall to Castle Black, three riders approach
the castle gates.
EXT. CASTLE BLACK GATES - DAY
A NW BROTHER opens the gates of Castle Black to find a
mounted Jon Snow and his companions.
From atop his horse, Jon sees who is waiting for him on the
balcony where Lord Commander Mormont used to stand: TORMUND.
Jon and his companions enter the courtyard, and the gates
close behind them.
INT. CASTLE BLACK CHAMBER - DAY
Longclaw in its scabbard. Jon’s hand reaches into frame and
takes it from the table.

INT. SHIP CABIN - DAY
Hands fasten a sword belt around a waist -- but the sword in
the belt is Needle, not Longclaw, and the hands belong to
Arya (we do not see her face). Match cut on her hand to
INT. WINTERFELL CHAMBER - DAY
A leather glove sliding onto Sansa’s hand with the aid of an
ATTENDANT. From here we move to shots of other costume pieces
being put on Sansa by the attendant, including leather armor
pieces. We do not see Sansa’s face.
INT. CASTLE BLACK CHAMBER - DAY
Jon puts the last item in his pack and fastens it shut. We
see a bit more of him, but at an oblique angle and/or
shrouded in shadow.
INT. SHIP CABIN - DAY
We see where Arya is for the first time: below decks on a
ship. We see her obliquely as well, as she turns to the
stairs and the light above.
INT. WINTERFELL CHAMBER - DAY
We tilt down on Sansa as the final piece of her costume is
put on. When the dresser steps away, we see Sansa
unobstructed for the first time.
Sansa stands, lifting her head from frame, and we match cut
to
INT. CASTLE BLACK CHAMBER - DAY
As Jon puts on his cloak, we tilt up from his torso to his
face. Once again, he wears all black. It always was his
color.
He steps forward, and we pan with him as he wipes camera into

We follow Sansa down a Winterfell corridor.

We follow Jon down a Castle Black walkway.

INT. SHIP CORRIDOR - DAY
We follow Arya down a ship’s corridor, up the stairs toward
the light.
EXT. SHIP’S DECK - CONTINUOUS
Arya emerges into the sunlight into a close up. She takes in
the scene for a beat, then steps forward.
INT. WINTERFELL GREAT HALL - DAY
We’re behind Sansa as she turns the corner into a room full
of Northern lords.
She regards her new subjects as she approaches them.
EXT. CASTLE BLACK MAIN COURTYARD - DAY
Jon walks down the last few stairs to the ground level, where
the last of the Free Folk await him: a few hundred men, women
and children.
Jon steps forward into the sea of waiting faces. There is no
suspicion in those faces, and no awe. Only trust. The Night’s
Watch used to hunt them, but they will follow this Night’s
Watchman.
We follow Jon in profile as he passes through the wildlings
to his left and his right (closer to camera). We match cut on
their passing vertical shapes to
EXT. SHIP’S DECK - DAY
Arya proceeding in profile down the deck, past deckhands,
ship’s masts and riggings. A similar match cut to

Sansa, as she moves down the center of the Great Hall, with
northern lords on either side of her. As she passes them,
they drop to one knee and bow their heads.

EXT. CASTLE BLACK COURTYARD - DAY
Jon meets up with Tormund who is already on horseback.
Someone else is waiting for him as well here: GHOST. The wolf
nuzzle’s Jon’s face, and he pets the scruff of Ghost’s neck.
Then Jon takes his horse from the Night’s Watchman holding
it, and mounts up.
INT. CASTLE BLACK TUNNEL - DAY
In a shot mirroring the first image of the pilot, we see Jon
and Tormund through the grate of the tunnel as the gate
rises, from a POV inside the tunnel.
[We do not see the wildlings behind them.]
EXT. SHIP’S DECK - DAY
On the bow of the ship, Arya steps into frame and looks west.
The Arya who left for Braavos was still a girl. This is a
different person altogether. She has been No One. She has
been Arya Stark of Winterfell. Who will she be next?
We wrap around Arya and pull back down the deck as her ship
sails west.
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY
In contrary motion to the above pull-back, we push down the
aisle as someone puts a crown on Sansa’s head.
On either side of the camera, the lords rise to their feet
and raise their swords to the ceiling.
NORTHERN LORDS
The Queen in the North! The Queen
in the North! The Queen in the
North!
We clear the lords and continue to move into a close up of
Sansa’s face.

EXT. TUNNEL - DAY
In a two shot that mirrors another shot from the pilot, Jon
and Tormund wait for the gate to finish opening.
We see them emerge from the tunnel. Things still look very
similar to the pilot shots, except Ghost is with them.
Then some Free Folk step into the fg, following them.
Overhead, from the top of the wall, we see more emerge, following Jon and Tormund.
And in a much wider side angle: Jon and Tormund with hundreds
of Free Folk following behind them, walking away from the
Wall. Many children are amongst them.
They all cross the No Man’s Land between the Wall and the
northern forest. Patches of grass show through what used to
be frozen tundra.
Ghost lopes out ahead of Jon, as Jon rides toward camera. Tormund rides beside him, and the last of the Free Folk are
behind them.
Jon and company ride away from camera. As Ghost, Jon and the
rest cross the treeline, we slowly pull back, and watch them
disappear into the forest.

Based on A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin
EXT. KING'S LANDING - DAY
The UNSULLIED stand in formation, immobile. Their phalanxes
are eight men deep and thirty men long, and their line
stretches nearly a mile.
GREY WORM stands at the head of the central phalanx. He looks
ahead, to the walls of King’s Landing.
EXT. KING’S LANDING BATTLEMENTS - DAY
We see the Unsullied from a high, distant perspective:
BRONN’s perspective, specifically, as he inspects the
LANNISTER FORCES on the city walls.
This is what a true Lannister deployment looks like: a line
of soldiers stretching into the distance as far as the eye
can see, prepared for an attack from any point.
Bronn looks over the battlement to see many more men at the
ready in the courtyard below, where many barrels are also
being stacked.
A LANNISTER GENERAL on the battlements supervises the barrel
stacking. Bronn questions the man:
BRONN
Oil?
LANNISTER GENERAL
Pitch, my lord.
Bronn looks at the barrels in the courtyard.
BRONN
How many barrels?
LANNISTER GENERAL
Five hundred, my lord.
Bronn looks out at the Unsullied.
BRONN
Get five hundred more.
LANNISTER GENERAL
Yes, my lord.
The general leaves to see to his order. Bronn continues down
the battlements, to JAIME LANNISTER.
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 1.
BRONN
I still enjoy it when they call me
“my lord.”
JAIME
The thrill will fade.
Bronn looks out at the Unsullied.
BRONN
If we live that long.
They both look out at the Unsullied for a moment.
BRONN
Men without cocks. Wouldn’t find me
fighting in an army if I had no
cock. What’s left to fight for?
JAIME
Gold?
BRONN
I spent my life around soldiers.
What do you think they spend that
gold on?
Point taken.
JAIME
Family?
BRONN
Not without a cock, you don’t.
Hmm.
JAIME
Maybe it really is all cocks in the
end.
BRONN
(re: Unsullied)
And yet, your brother has chosen to
side with the cockless.
JAIME
Yes, he’s always been a champion of
the downtrodden.
A trumpet sounds from a tower above. Jaime and Bronn return
their attention to the distance.
CONTINUED:
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 2.
EXT. KING'S LANDING - DAY
The DOTHRAKI HORDE breaks the horizon and heads toward the
city, 10,000 screamers strong.
The Dothraki pour through the gaps in the Unsullied
phalanxes; their passage does not cause a single Unsullied to
flinch.
EXT. KING’S LANDING BATTLEMENTS - DAY
The Dothraki present their customary show of strength before
the city walls, a cyclone of horse and steel and screaming
warriors, swirling before the immobile Unsullied.
And then, without warning or apparent signal, they stop in
front of the Unsullied and fall silent, in ready position,
eerily motionless, staring up at the nervous defenders of the
city.
BRONN
I think we’re about to be the
downtrodden.
EXT. DANY'S FLAGSHIP - DAY
TYRION LANNISTER stands on the starboard deck of Dany’s
flagship, standing next to VARYS and THEON GREYJOY.
He steps away from them, heading toward the bow, where JON
SNOW stands with DAVOS SEAWORTH.
Tyrion joins them. The three men look at King’s Landing, in
the distance.
Nearby JORAH MORMONT and MISSANDEI look across the water, and
the few escort ships following behind their flagship.
Dany herself is notably absent.
JON
How many people live here?
TYRION
A million, give or take.
Jon tries to get his head around this notion.
JON
That’s more people than we have in
the entire North.
(MORE)

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 3.
Crammed into that. Why would anyone
want to live that way?
TYRION
There’s more work in the city. And
the brothels are far superior.
INT. DANY'S FLAGSHIP - STORAGE AREA - DAY
In a dark storage area below decks, amidst various crates and
sacks of food, THE HOUND approaches a crate that is separate
from the rest. The top is padlocked on two sides.
He stands in front of it and listens to the silence.
He raises a finger, and taps the crate once, quietly.
A barrage of thumping and snarling explodes from inside the
crate, shaking it on the floorboards.
Satisfied that their precious cargo is undead and well, the
Hound walks away.
INT. CERSEI'S BEDROOM - DAY
CERSEI LANNISTER has heard news from QYBURN. Jaime is also
present. THE MOUNTAIN stands at his post nearby, silent as
always.
CERSEI
Why isn’t she with them?
QYBURN
I’m afraid I don’t know, your
grace. No one has seen her.
CERSEI
And the rest of them?
QYBURN
They’re on their way to the
Dragonpit now.
CERSEI
Including our brother?
QYBURN
Yes, your grace.
Cersei approaches the Mountain.

CERSEI
If anything goes wrong, kill the
silver-haired bitch first. Then our
brother, then the bastard who calls
himself king. The rest of them you
can kill in any order you see fit.
Ser Gregor nods. Both Jaime and Qyburn appear troubled.
CERSEI
Come, Ser Gregor. It’s time for us
to meet our guests.
Ser Gregor opens the door. Cersei leaves her chambers. Jaime,
Qyburn and Gregor follow.
EXT. ROAD TO DRAGONPIT - DAY
Tyrion, Jon and company approach on the main road: Davos,
Varys, Missandei, Jorah, Theon. QHONO and nine other DOTHRAKI
march with them, keeping a watchful eye. They wear the burnt,
torn, bloodied coats of Lannister officers they murdered in
ep.704.
The Hound brings up the rear of the procession, walking
alongside a donkey cart, which carries the padlocked crate
seen in the hold of the ship previously. Dany is still not
here.
Missandei looks up, and sees a foreboding piece of the
Dragonpit peeking above the foliage line.
MISSANDEI
Why did they build it?
JORAH
Dragons don’t understand the
difference between what’s theirs
and what isn’t. Land, livestock. Children. Letting them roam free
around a city was a problem.
TYRION
I imagine it was a sad joke at the
end. That entire colossal arena,
for a few sickly creatures smaller
than dogs. But in the beginning,
when it was home to Balerion the
Dread...
Tyrion looks up at the visible section of the Dragonpit as
they approach a bend, and speaks with admiration:
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 5.
TYRION
It must have been the most
dangerous place in the world.
Davos isn’t looking up; he’s looking straight ahead.
DAVOS
Maybe it still is.
A contingent of TWENTY LANNISTER GUARDS has rounded the bend
and is heading their way, led by Bronn.
Also in tow: BRIENNE and PODRICK PAYNE. They’re walking on
their own, but the three guards on Brienne and one on Pod
make it clear that they are guests of the nation.
Our group stops. The Dothraki get ready to fight, but Tyrion
waves them down. They wait for Bronn to approach.
All are surprised to see Brienne and Pod here. But no one is
more surprised than the Hound.
BRONN
Welcome, my lords.
(re: Brienne and Pod)
Your friends arrived before you
did. I’ve been sent to escort you
all to the meeting.
They follow Bronn -- but Pod stays behind, face to face with
Tyrion. Neither man thought they’d ever see the other again.
TYRION
A pleasant surprise in an
unpleasant situation.
Pod fully agrees.
POD
I never thought I’d see you again, my lord.
TYRION
Supporting the enemy, no less.
POD
Hard to blame you.
TYRION
Cersei will anyway.
POD
I’m glad you’re alive.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 6.
The Lannister rear guard is upon them. Their faces tell
Tyrion and Pod that it’s time to move on -- and Bronn
approaches to do the same:
BRONN
Come on. You can suck his magic
cock later.
Tyrion smiles. He’s missed these lads.
EXT. ROAD TO DRAGONPIT - NEW VANTAGE POINT - DAY
Our group walks onward, toward the Dragonpit, the Lannister
guards outnumbering the Dothraki more than two-to-one.
A Lannister guard walks close behind the Hound. Too close.
LANNISTER GUARD
What’s in there?
The Hound looks the man in the eye.
HOUND
Fuck off.
The guard is old enough to have a healthy fear of Joffrey’s
mad dog. He doesn’t push.
The Hound stays with his cart, looking ahead of him to
Brienne, the woman who almost killed him.
Brienne looks back at him. Brienne slows down, allowing the
Hound to catch up alongside her. He throws her a sideways
glance, then looks back to his Lannister friend.
The guard falls back, letting them speak privately. The Hound
returns his gaze forward.
BRIENNE
I thought you were dead.
HOUND
Not yet. You came pretty close.
They walk in silence for a moment.
BRIENNE
I was only trying to protect her.
HOUND
You and me both.

BRIENNE
She’s alive. Arya.
The Hound has not heard this yet.
HOUND
Where?
BRIENNE
Winterfell.
HOUND
Who’s protecting her, if you’re
here?
Brienne smiles.
BRIENNE
The only one who needs protecting
is the one who gets in her way.
A rare smile from the Hound.
HOUND
Won’t be me.
Tyrion, Varys, Pod and Bronn walk together, near the front.
The first three are acutely aware of the tension inherent in
this situation. Bronn is also, though he pretends not to be.
TYRION
Here we are. The Heroes of
Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a
reunion.
POD
It is, my lord.
TYRION
I don’t think I’m anyone’s lord
anymore, Podrick. Save the titles
for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
BRONN
I’m sure your new queen will be
happy to restore yours, if she ends
up on the throne.

You’ve been thinking about our new
queen.

Perhaps you’ve been reconsidering
your allegiances. Remember my
offer, whatever they’re paying you,
I’ll pay double.
VARYS
And that would be double what, now,
exactly?
BRONN
Don’t you worry about me. I’m doing
all right. Looking after myself.
TYRION
Are you? Helping me to arrange this
meeting wasn’t exactly looking
after yourself, was it? You put
yourself at risk.
BRONN
I put yourself at risk. Important
difference. It’s your head Queen
Cersei’s offered a bag of gold for,
it’s not mine. Now, thanks to me,
she’s got two traitors’ heads
coming right through her door. She
can lop them both off, as soon as
she gets tired of the clever words
that pour out their pieholes. All
thanks to Ser Bronn of the Fucking
Blackwater. If that’s not looking
after myself, I don’t know what is.
They walk in silence for a long tense beat, as Tyrion studies
Bronn.
TYRION
It’s good to see you again.
Bronn smiles in spite of himself.
BRONN
Yeah. You too.
The Hound unlatches his cart from the donkey, and turns to
his Lannister guard.
HOUND
Anyone touches it, I’ll kill you
first.
Sometimes, being a Lannister guard is just no fun at all.

They all enter the Dragonpit.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - DAY
They enter the ruins of an architectural marvel, detritus
scattered around the edges.
The weight of history stays their tongues. That, and the
twenty more LANNISTER GUARDS stationed in the stands. They
take in the scene as Bronn leads them to their seats.
Cersei has not made fancy preparations. Just the appropriate
number of chairs, grouped according to allegiances, with a
pergola to shade them from the sun.
Cersei’s chairs are on the end, facing the entrance. Her own
chair is larger and more ornate than the rest.
To Cersei’s right, there are six chairs for Dany’s group;
Bronn motions Tyrion in that direction.
To Cersei’s left, there are three chairs for Jon’s group;
Bronn motions Jon in that direction.
They make their way to their appointed chairs, but do not
sit. The Dothraki all fall in behind Dany’s chairs, leaving
Jon, Davos and Brienne hanging in the wind. The Hound stands
to Jon’s right, nearest to Cersei’s podium.
Bronn puts his arm around Pod.
BRONN
Come on, Pod. Let’s you and me go
have a drink while the fancy folks
talk.
However friendly Bronn’s tone, this is not a request. Pod
gives Brienne one last look, and exits through a side
entrance with Bronn.
The twenty Lannister guards that escorted them into the
Dragonpit remain, however, in formation on either side of the
entrance through which they came.
Our group exchange glances. The bulk of the glances are aimed
at Tyrion.
The Hound approaches him.
HOUND
I left this shit city because I
didn’t want to die in it.

HOUND
Am I going to die in this shit
city?
TYRION
You might.
HOUND
And this was all your idea.
Tyrion looks around at the Lannisters who may murder them.
Honesty forces him to nod. The Hound takes a breath.
HOUND
Seems every bad idea has some
Lannister cunt behind it.
TYRION
And some Clegane cunt to help them
see it through.
The sound of armored men marching draws all their attention
back to the entrance. The marching grows louder and louder.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - CERSEI’S ARRIVAL - CONTINUOUS
The Mountain enters first, running point on Cersei and her
entourage: Jaime, Qyburn, Euron. The entirety of her
QUEENSGUARD (6) surrounds them. Ten more LANNISTER GUARDS
bring up the rear, for good measure.
The Hound recognizes the Mountain on sight.
Without hesitation, Cersei heads toward her seat, veering
toward Jon’s side of the Dragonpit.
Jon watches her, trying not to look out of his element.
Jaime passes right by Brienne. His expression asks her what
the hell she’s doing here, but unfortunately this is a
question her expression is incapable of answering.
Cersei’s gaze goes to Tyrion. Who killed her mother, who
killed her father, who is now wearing the Hand pin of
Cersei’s nemesis.
Euron is smiling, always smiling, especially at Theon.
The Hound steps away from his post behind Brienne and walks
directly toward Cersei’s riser. The Mountain steps out in
front of his Queen and onto the ground. Nobody else moves.

The Hound’s hand is nowhere near his sword. As far as he is
concerned, none of them are even here. Only the Mountain.
HOUND
Remember me?
He looks into the Mountain’s dead eyes.
HOUND
Yeah. You do.
(looks closer)
You’re even fucking uglier than I
am now. What did they do to you?
(no answer)
Doesn’t matter. That’s not how it
ends for you, brother. You know
who’s coming for you. You’ve always
known.
The Mountain has no comment, he turns and walks back to his
place behind Cersei. The Hound walks away from them all,
toward the door through which he came.
CERSEI
Where is she?
TYRION
She’ll be here soon.
Cersei tries to keep her extreme displeasure in check, and
nearly succeeds.
CERSEI
Didn’t travel with you?
TYRION
No.
Jaime is still looking at Brienne.
Cersei notices Jaime looking at Brienne.
Brienne looks away, too late.
Cersei looks to Jaime, who is saved from having to explain
this by a familiar cry that comes from above, and the sound
of beating wings.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - DANY’S ARRIVAL - CONTINUOUS
The wings grow louder, and soon they’re moving enough air to
flutter the fabric of the pergola.
CONTINUED:

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 12.
Everyone but Cersei emerges from the pergola in time to see
it:
Drogon lands on the lip of the Dragonpit, with DAENERYS
TARGARYEN on his back, crushing the area where his claws set
down.
Cersei stares at her enemy, this baby-faced usurper who’s
come to take what’s hers.
Rhaegal circles in the sky overhead.
Drogon clambers down the stands a bit; some of the more
deteriorated stone crumbles beneath his weight.
As Dany climbs out onto his wing, Euron stares at the beast,
entranced. He looks to Cersei, then back to Dany.
By this time, Dany is climbing off Drogon’s wing, to the
ground of the Dragonpit.
As she makes her way to the gathering, Drogon takes to the
air again to join his brother, the two of them rising in
gyres to the sky overhead, remaining in sight.
Most are cowed by the sight of these beasts, including Dany's
allies.
Not Cersei. All she displays is disdain for the theatricality
of the gesture.
Jon Snow sits. Davos and Brienne follow suit.
Dany arrives at her chair and sits. All her people follow
suit.
This gathering represents almost all the power in the living
world, and they are all aware of it. No one is in a rush to
speak the first word, because bosses don’t rush.
CERSEI
We’ve been here for some time.
DANY
My apologies.
Dany nods to Tyrion. Tyrion stands.

expression tells him that Jaime is not a fan.
TYRION
I think we ought to begin with
larger concerns.
EURON
Then why are you talking? You’re
the smallest concern here.
Euron rises from his seat and approaches Tyrion.
Tyrion turns to Theon.
TYRION
Do you remember when we discussed
dwarf jokes?
THEON
His wasn’t even good.
TYRION
He explained it at the end. Never
explain, it always ruins it.
EURON
We don’t even let your kind live in
the Iron Islands, you know. We kill
you at birth. An act of mercy for
the parents.
JAIME
(to Euron)
Perhaps you ought to sit down.
EURON
Why?
Cersei deals with Euron before he can derail things further.
CERSEI
Sit down or leave.
The Mountain steps forward and stares at Euron.
Euron’s smile wavers a bit, and he sits.

TYRION
We are a group of people who do not
like one another, as this recent
demonstration has shown.
(beat)
We have suffered at each other’s
hands. We have lost people we love
at each other’s hands. If all we
wanted was more of the same, there
would be no need for this
gathering. We are entirely capable
of waging war against each other
without meeting face to face.
CERSEI
So instead we’re going to settle
our differences and live together
in harmony for the rest of our
days.
TYRION
We all know that will never happen.
CERSEI
Then why are we here?
Jon stands.
JON
This isn’t about living in harmony. It’s just about living. The same
thing is coming for all of us: a
general you can’t negotiate with. An army that doesn’t leave corpses
behind on the battlefield. (beat)
Lord Tyrion tells me a million
people live in this city. They're
about to become a million more
soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
CERSEI
I imagine for most of them it would
be an improvement.
JON
This is serious. I wouldn't be here
if it weren't.
CERSEI
I don't think it's serious at all.
I think it's another bad joke.

If my brother Jaime has informed me
correctly, you're asking me for a
truce.
DANY
Yes. That’s all.
CERSEI
That’s all. Pull my armies back and
stand down while you go on your
monster hunt. Or while you solidify
and expand your position. Hard for
me to know which it is, with my
armies pulled back. Until you
return and march on my capital with
four times the men.
DANY
Your capital will be safe until the
Northern threat is dealt with. You
have my word.
CERSEI
The word of a would-be usurper.
Dany doesn’t like that word, but before she can escalate,
Tyrion speaks:
TYRION
There is no conversation that will
erase the past fifty years. (to Cersei and Jaime)
We have something to show you.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - HOUND’S ARRIVAL - A FEW MOMENTS
LATER
We follow the Hound into the Dragonpit; the crate he brought
in on the cart is now on his back, secured with ropes.
He brings the crate into the middle of the space between the
summit factions and puts it down. He throws the ropes aside.
He unlocks the padlocks and takes it off. He opens the top
and steps back.
Everyone watches the open crate. People crane their necks
trying to see over the lip of the crate.
Nothing happens.

CERSEI (CONT'D)

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 16.
Jon is worried. If this thing doesn’t do what it’s supposed
to, this whole gathering has been for naught.
Impatient, the Hound kicks over the crate, knocking it on
it’s side. The WIGHT bolts out of his casket.
He no longer wears his winter clothing, only scraps of cloth
that reveal the rotting mess of his body, and the holes where
the Hound slammed him down on Drogon’s spikes. He has a metal
collar around his neck...
... but we don’t have a chance to properly register this as
he’s making for Cersei, snarling and gnashing.
Cersei recoils.
Feeling no undead camaraderie with the creature whatever, the
Mountain draws his sword and steps to Cersei’s side, ready to
slice the thing in two.
The creature is almost upon Cersei. It reaches for her --
-- and is roughly jerked to the ground.
The Hound holds the chain attached to the wight’s collar, one
we probably didn’t notice until now. The other end of the
chain is secured to the bottom of the crate.
The wight comes for the Hound.
The Hound draws his sword and cuts the wight neatly in half, right through the waist.
Its legs continue kicking.
The sight has the desired effect on everyone. They are seeing
something that many of them thought was impossible. Cersei
and Jaime try to process what they’re seeing. As does
Brienne.
The wight’s torso keeps coming for the Hound, crawling over
the ground, shattered teeth gnashing.
The Hound chops an arm off at the elbow. The arm keeps
flexing and grasping.
The demonstration shakes Cersei in a way few things can.
And though Tyrion is seeing this for the first time as well,
he spends more time watching Cersei than he does watching the
wight itself. Noting her reaction.
Everyone who has never seen a wight is shocked as well.

Everyone except for Qyburn, that is, who steps forward to
pick up the still-moving hand and forearm, and beholds it
with fascination.
With a flint, Davos sparks a torch and hands it to Jon.
He takes the hand from Qyburn, ignites it and drops it. The
hand dies.
JON
We can destroy them by burning
them.
(beat)
And we can destroy them with
dragonglass.
He draws a dragonglass dagger.
JON
If we don’t win this fight, then
that...
He points to the wight’s torso as it crawls toward him with
its single arm.
JON
... is the fate of every person in
the world.
When the wight’s torso reaches him, he picks it up by its
remaining wrist, and stabs it with the dragonglass. It
deanimates and falls to pieces, ending the demonstration.
JON
There is only one war that matters:
the Great War. And it is here.
Dany supports Jon’s claim:
DANY
I didn’t believe it, until I saw
them. I saw them all.
Cersei looks at her, but finds herself at a rare loss for
words.
JAIME
How many?
DANY
A hundred thousand. At least.
Cersei weighs what she hears.

Jon, Tyrion and Dany watch her, hopeful.
Euron has stood up, and walked over to the bones of the
deanimated wight. He touches it.
EURON
Can they swim?
JON
No.
EURON
Good.
He drops the bone.
EURON
I’m taking my fleet back to the
Iron Islands.
Cersei is taken aback.
CERSEI
What are you talking about?
EURON
I’ve been around the world. I’ve
seen everything, things you
couldn’t imagine. And this...
He pokes at the wight’s skull with his foot.
EURON
This is the only thing I’ve ever
seen that terrifies me.
He smiles, savoring the thrill of a new feeling, then turns
to Dany.
EURON
I’m going back to my island. You
should go back to yours. When
winter’s over, we’ll be the only
ones left alive.
Exit Euron.
When Cersei’s surprise at this betrayal recedes, she has
something to say.

He’s right to be afraid. And a
coward to run.

If those things come for us, there
will be no kingdoms to rule.
Everything we’ve suffered will have
been for nothing. Everything we’ve
lost will have been for nothing.
(to Dany)
The Crown accepts your truce. Until
the dead are defeated, they are the
true enemy.
The relief is palpable all around.
Until Cersei turns to Jon.
CERSEI
In return, the King in the North
will extend this truce. He will
remain in the North where he
belongs, he will not take up arms
against the Lannisters. He will not
choose sides.
DANY
Just the King in the North? Not me?
CERSEI
I would never ask it of you. You
would never agree to it, and if you
did I would trust you even less
than I do now. I ask it only of Ned
Stark’s son. I know Ned Stark’s son
will be true to his word.
Jon looks to the people whose opinions he values most: Davos. Dany.
JON
I am true to my word, or I try to
be. (beat)
That is why I cannot give you what
you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself
to Queen Daenerys of House
Targaryen.
This admission shocks Dany, who can’t believe he would
jeopardize the Great War to tell this truth.
It shocks everyone else because they had no idea Jon had bent
the knee to Dany in the first place.
Cersei stands.

Cersei walks away from the gathering. All the Queensguard and
Lannister guards follow.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - EN ROUTE TO EXIT
As Jaime passes Brienne on the way out, she stands and
follows him toward the exit, talking as she goes.
BRIENNE
Ser Jaime.
JAIME
It’s been good to see you. I
imagine the next time will be
across a battlefield.
BRIENNE
We both saw what just happened. We
both saw... that thing.
JAIME
Yes, I’m not looking forward to
seeing more of them. But I’m loyal
to the Queen, and you’re loyal to
Sansa and her dolt brother, so--
BRIENNE
Fuck loyalty!
She hits him on his shoulder.
Hearing these words come from Brienne’s mouth is enough to
stop Jaime in his tracks.
JAIME
Fuck loyalty?
BRIENNE
This goes beyond houses and honor
and oaths. Talk to the Queen.
Jaime turns to see Cersei in the doorway, watching him stand
there with Brienne.

Jon faces the reactions to what he’s done.
DAVOS
I wish you hadn’t done that.
DANY
I’m grateful for your loyalty. But
my dragon died so that we could be
here. If it’s all for nothing, then
he died for nothing.
JON
I know.
TYRION
I’m pleased you bent the knee to
our Queen. I would have advised it,
had you asked. But... have you ever
considered learning how to lie?
Every now and then, just a bit?
JON
I’m not going to swear an oath I
can’t uphold. Talk about my father
if you want, tell me that’s the
attitude that got him killed. But
when enough people make false
promises, words stop meaning
anything. Then there are no more
answers, only better and better
lies. And lies won’t help us in
this fight.
TYRION
That is indeed a problem. The
more immediate problem is that
we’re fucked.
DAVOS
Any ideas as to how we might change
that state of affairs?

TYRION
Only one. Everyone stays here. And
I go and talk to my sister.
DANY
I didn’t come all this way to have
my Hand murdered.
TYRION
I don’t want Cersei to murder me
either. I could have just stayed in
my cell and saved a great deal of
trouble.
JON
I did this. I should go.
TYRION
She’ll definitely murder you.
Tyrion does appreciate these offers. But:
TYRION
I go see my sister alone. Or we all
go home, and we’re right back where
we started.
The certainty of his statement brooks no further dissent.
Dany nods.
Tyrion takes a breath, turns and heads for the exit, alone. They all watch him disappear from the Dragonpit.
INT. CORRIDOR TO CERSEI'S OFFICE - DAY
The Mountain leads Tyrion down a Red Keep corridor, toward
Cersei’s chambers.
Tyrion looks up at the Mountain, towering over him.
The Mountain does not look down at him. His eyes remain
straight ahead.
Tyrion is deeply regretting this idea.

You spoke with her.
JAIME
At her. Until she kicked me out.
She thinks I was an idiot to trust
you. A lot of people seem to think
that, actually.
TYRION
I’m about to step into a room with
the most murderous woman in the
world, who’s already tried to kill
me twice. That I know of. Who’s an
idiot?
JAIME
I suppose we should say goodbye,
one idiot to another.
Tyrion nods.
Gregor opens the door, and Tyrion goes to speak with his
sister.
INT. CERSEI'S OFFICE - DAY
Tyrion enters. Gregor closes the door.
Cersei is seated behind her desk, which was once her father’s
desk, in the office at the far end of the room. Tyrion starts
the long walk toward her, along the small council table.
The Mountain’s heavy footfalls thud behind him. Tyrion stops. The footsteps stop. Tyrion starts again.
When Tyrion reaches the office threshold, the Mountain takes
up his post next to the Lannister lion ironwork.
Tyrion stands before his sister. Cersei regards him, but does
not speak.
CERSEI
I shouldn’t be surprised. I suppose
she’s your kind of woman: a foreign
whore who doesn't know her place.

A foreign whore you can’t abduct,
beat or intimidate. That must be
difficult for you.

So you bring her here with her pet
Northerner, whom you’ve convinced

CERSEI
-- and now you’ve got both working
towards the same goal. The goal
you’ve worked toward your entire
life--
TYRION
Cersei, I didn’t know--
CERSEI
-- the destruction of this family.
It is the same accusation she’s leveled at him for decades.
He finds it exhausting and exasperating.
TYRION
I am the one preventing that from
happening! Daenerys didn’t want to
debate and negotiate. She didn’t
want to bring you words, she wanted
to bring you fire and blood, until
I advised her otherwise. I don’t
want to destroy our family. I never
have.
CERSEI
You killed our father.
TYRION
After he sentenced me to death for
a crime I didn’t commit. (beat)
Yes, I killed him. Hate me for it
if you want. I hate myself for it, in spite of what he was, in spite
of what he did to me.
CERSEI
Oh, poor little man. Your papa was
mean to you. Do you have any idea
what you did when you fired that
crossbow? You left us open. You
laid us bare for the vultures and

apart.

I have never been more sorry about
anything, I--

I will not hear it, not from you--
TYRION
Please, just let me--
CERSEI
I will not hear it.
She means it.
TYRION
All right.
Tyrion stands, and steps over to the threshold of the office,
where the Mountain stands.
TYRION
You love your family, and I have
destroyed it. I will always be a
threat. So put an end to me.
The Mountain turns to face him. Tyrion looks up at him, then
returns his attentions to Cersei.
TYRION
If it weren’t for me, you’d have a
mother. If it weren’t for me, you’d
have a father. If it weren’t for me
you’d have two beautiful children. I’ve thought about killing you more
times than I can count. (beat)
Do it! Say the word.
He’s right. It’s within her grasp, what she’s wanted so badly
for so long. She looks to the Mountain, who looks to her,
waiting for the signal. With a nod of the head she can have
it.
She looks away.

The Mountain turns away, and Tyrion steps away from him. He
steps over to the side table, picks up a wine vase, and pours
a glass of wine for himself. He takes a very large drink.
He then pours a glass for Cersei, walks over, and sets it
down beside her. He returns to the side table for his own
wine and resumes a respectful distance on the other side of
the desk.
TYRION
I am more sorry about the children
than you could ever know.
CERSEI
I will not (hear)--
TYRION
I don’t care. I loved them. You
know I did. You know it in your
heart, if there’s anything left of
it.
She does know. She drinks.
CERSEI
It doesn’t matter. Your love
doesn’t matter. Your feelings don’t
matter. I don’t care why you did
what you did. I only care what it
cost us. It cost us our future.
TYRION
If there’s no future, then why are
we here? Why did you allow me to
come?
CERSEI
Not to help my enemies collaborate
in my destruction.
TYRION
Yes, no not what you hoped for. But
you must have hoped for something.
He is more right than he knows. She deflects.

Why?
TYRION
Because I think she will make the
world a better place.
CERSEI
You said she’d destroy King’s
Landing.
She makes a fair point.
TYRION
She knows herself. She chose an
advisor who would check her worst
impulses, instead of feeding them.
That’s the difference between you.
CERSEI
I don’t care about checking my
worst impulses. I don’t care about
making the world a better place. Hang the world.
Cersei folds her hands across her stomach.
CERSEI
That thing you dragged here, I know
what it is and I know what it
means. And when it came at me, I
didn’t think about the world. Not
at all. As soon as it opened its
mouth, the world disappeared for
me, right down its black throat.
Tyrion notices the barely perceptible movement of Cersei’s
bottom hand over her belly.

You’re pregnant.
She stays silent for too long, long enough to tell him that
he’s right.
And once she knows he knows, she can think of nothing else to

EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - DAY
Jon is pondering, looking at the detritus on the ground, when
Dany approaches. He has a small dragon jawbone in his hands.
JON
No one is less happy about this
than I am.
DANY
I know. I respect what you did. I
wish you hadn’t done it, but I
respect it.
Dany steps closer to Jon and takes the small jawbone from his
hands. Their fingers touch briefly.
DANY
This place was the beginning of the
end for my family. (in Valyrian)
Zaldrizes buzdari iksos daor. (for Jon’s benefit)
A dragon is not a slave. They were
terrifying, extraordinary, they
filled people with wonder and awe. And we locked them in here. They
wasted away. They grew small. And
we grew small as well. We weren’t
extraordinary without them. We were
just like everyone else.

He scores a small smile.
DANY
You were right, from the beginning.
If I’d trusted you everything would

So what now?

I can’t forget what I saw north of
the Wall. And I can’t pretend that
Cersei won’t take back half the
country the moment I march north.

It appears Tyrion’s assessment was
correct. (clarifying)
We’re fucked.
They allow themselves a brief gallows laugh.
The laughter fades, but they continue to hold each others’ gaze until it is pleasantly uncomfortable.

LITTLEFINGER
It’s not easy for ravens to fly in
these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to
send word earlier--
SANSA
No. This is the way he is. The way
he’s always been. He never asks my
opinion. Why would he start now?
LITTLEFINGER
I can’t believe he’d surrender the
Northern crown without consulting
you--
SANSA
(holding up scroll)
This is his writing! His signature!
He pledged to fight for Daenerys
Targaryen. He bent the knee!
Littlefinger moves about the room, examining an ancient First
Men carving of a wolf.
LITTLEFINGER
I’ve heard gossip that the Dragon
Queen is quite beautiful.
SANSA
What does that have to do with
anything?
LITTLEFINGER
Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
Sansa stares at him in disbelief.

SANSA
Even if I wanted to... Arya would
never go along. She’s always loved
Jon. Far more than she ever loved
me. And she’d kill anyone who
betrayed her family.
LITTLEFINGER
You’re her family, too. Would Arya
really murder her own sister?
SANSA
Do you know what she is now? Do you
know what the Faceless Men are?
LITTLEFINGER
Only by reputation. They worship
the God of Death, I believe.

I never trust godly men.

They’re killers. And Arya was one
of them. (beat)

She’s your sister. You know her far
better than I ever could.
He watches Sansa for a long beat.
LITTLEFINGER
Sometimes, when I’m trying to
understand a person’s motives, I
play a little game. I assume the
worst. What's the worst reason they
could possibly have for saying what
they say, and doing what they do?

JON
We can sail with them to White
Harbor and meet the Dothraki here
on the Kingsroad, then ride
together to Winterfell.
JORAH
Perhaps you should fly to
Winterfell, your grace. You have
many enemies in the North.
Thousands fell fighting your
father. All it takes is one angry
man with a crossbow-- he’ll see
your silver hair on the Kingsroad
and know that one well-placed bolt
will make him a hero. The Man Who
Killed the Conqueror.
Dany sees the logic in this. But before she can speak:
JON
It’s your decision, your grace. But
if we’re going to be allies in this
war, it’s important for the
Northerners to see us as allies. If
we sail to White Harbor together, I
think it sends a better message.
She weighs her choice, then says to Jorah:
DANY
I’ve not come to conquer the North. I’m coming to save the North.
She turns to Jon.
DANY
We sail together.
Jon doesn’t quite smile because smiling would seem
inappropriate. But still, that almost looks like a smile.
Jorah nods in deference. But he’s not smiling at all. Fucking

Dany looks over the map table, in a shot reminiscent of the

with them.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 35.
THEON
Jon.
Jon and Davos stop and look at him.
THEON
Could I speak with you?
Jon considers him for a beat before nodding to Davos. Davos
nods in return and walks away.
THEON
What you did in King’s Landing...
what you said...
Jon isn’t sure what Theon’s talking about and Theon himself
struggles to make himself clear.
THEON
You could have lied to Cersei.
About bending the knee to Daenerys.
You risked everything, to tell an
enemy the truth.
JON
We went down there to make peace.
And it seems to me we need to be
honest with each other if we’re
going to fight together.
Theon stares at the floor. He hates himself in this moment, he truly does.
THEON
You’ve always known what was right. Even when we were all young and
stupid, you always knew. Every step
you take, it’s always the right
step.
JON
It's not. It may seem that way from
the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of
things that I regret.
THEON
Not compared to me, you haven't.
Jon thinks about it.
JON
No, not compared to you.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 36.
THEON
I always wanted to do the right
thing, be the right kind of person.
But I never knew what that meant.
Theon is close to tears and Jon watches him, sympathy
fighting with his revulsion for the man who betrayed his
family.
THEON
It always seemed like there was...
like there was an impossible choice
I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
JON
Our father was more of a father to
you than yours ever was.
THEON
He was.
JON
And you betrayed him. Betrayed his
memory.
THEON
I did.
JON
But you never lost him. He’s a part
of you. Just like he’s a part of
me.
Theon looks up at Jon.
THEON
But the things I’ve done...
JON
It's not my place to forgive you
for all of it. But what I can
forgive, I do. You don't need to
choose. You're a Greyjoy. And
you're a Stark.
Theon is deeply moved. For a moment he can’t speak.
THEON
When I was Ramsay’s prisoner, Yara
tried to save me. She’s the only
one who tried to save me.
(beat)
She needs me now.

JON
So why are you still talking to me?
EXT. DRAGONSTONE BEACH - DAY
The IRONBORN prepare to set sail, with HARRAG giving orders.
The Ironborn quiet down when they see Theon approaching.
Theon faces the men, whose expressions are flat and hostile.
Whatever natural leadership abilities Theon once possessed,
he lost them a long time ago.
THEON
All of us chose to follow Yara. We
left the Iron Islands for Yara. She
would never leave one of us behind.
We’re not leaving her behind.
HARRAG
Your sister’s dead.
THEON
She’s not dead.
HARRAG
She’s dead. Even if Euron hasn’t
cut her throat yet, she’s dead.
THEON
She’s our queen--
HARRAG
She’s your sister. And you left her
to die.
The men nod. Little shit abandoned his own sister.
THEON
I did. I ran from my uncle. I was a
coward.
Harrag steps closer to him.
HARRAG
So why in fuck’s name should we
listen to you? They say the dead
can’t swim. We’re gonna sail east,
find a nice quiet island, kill all
the men and take their wives for
ourselves.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 38.
THEON
We’re done with all that.
HARRAG
Who says we are?
THEON
Yara did. She made a pledge. We’re
going to find her. And we’re going
to set her free.
Harrag spits in his face, a great gob of slimy, Ironborn
spittle.
Theon closes his eyes and wipes the spit from his face.
HARRAG
Run away, little Theon. That’s what
you do best.
Theon doesn’t respond. But he doesn’t look away from Harrag.
Harrag, a pit bull of a human being, finds this look
provocative.
He punches Theon in the face, hard.
Theon fights back. It’s not a pretty fight. Harrag brawls
dirty, all elbows and head butts.
He wears heavy rings on his fingers, rings he paid the iron
price for, and these do extra damage with each punch he
lands.
Theon fights with great heart, but he’s smaller and less
experienced at this type of street fighting.
He lands a few shots but none of them seem to affect his
opponent.
Harrag knocks him down with a vicious cross, opening a gash
just above Theon’s eye.
The men cheer.
Theon staggers to his feet, blood streaming down over his
eye.
Harrag attacks again. Theon tries to defend himself but is
overpowered.
Theon goes down again.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 39.
This time the cheers are a bit sparser.
Harrag pants as he stares down at Theon. The big man is
getting winded.
HARRAG
Stay down or I’ll kill you.
Theon-- bleeding from the nose, the mouth, from the deep gash
above his eye-- rises to his feet again.
He’s having a hard time seeing, he’s so bloodied. But he
throws himself at Harrag, trying to land a good shot.
Harrag knocks him down a third time.
Harrag himself is so exhausted now he bends over, hands on
his knees, watching Theon.
The Ironborn watch Theon, too. He might not be the world’s
greatest fighter. But fuck, he’s not quitting.
Theon, his face a bloody mess, rises to his feet a third
time.
Harrag takes a deep breath. He charges at Theon, throwing
everything he’s got left at his adversary.
Clutching Theon’s face in his big, dirty hands, Harrag slams
his knee into Theon’s groin.
But Theon has no balls.
Just the slightest possible smile from Theon, as he receives
his first ever benefit from castration.
He slams his forehead into Harrag’s nose, the single greatest
headbutt in the history of filmed headbutts.
Harrag staggers back, hands covering the streaming mess of
his nose.
Theon tackles him and proceeds to ground and pound the living
shit out of the big man, who is too tired to defend himself.
Soon Harrag lies motionless on the beach.
Theon stands. He looks like he’s just been spat out of a
thresher.
He nearly falls but one of the Ironborn men catches him and
holds him.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 40.
Theon looks over the men. They’re simple men. They just like
to see their leaders bleed for them.
Theon spits out a gob of blood and nods.
THEON
Not for me. For Yara.
IRONBORN
YARA!
He nods and heads for the skiffs.
The Ironborn follow.
EXT. WINTERFELL - BATTLEMENTS - DAY
Sansa stands alone, staring across the snow-shrouded moors.
She wears a hood to protect her from the wind and the snow,
making her look like the French Lieutenant’s Woman, a
reference Sophie Turner will just have to Google.
We don’t have access to her interior monologue, but we’re
looking at Dark Sansa here, that much is clear.
She closes her eyes for a beat, then opens them.
The decision has been made.
She turns and walks back toward the towers.
As she passes a waiting STARK GUARD:
SANSA
Have my sister brought to the great
hall.
The Guard nods and Sansa keeps walking, never looking back, never checking her stride.
INT. WINTERFELL GREAT HALL - DAY
ARYA STARK walks into the great hall, escorted by two STARK
GUARDS.
Sansa sits at the high table. Bran sits by her side, in his
wheelchair. He watches Arya with no trace of brotherly
affection.
MAESTER WOLKAN stands near the high table.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 41.
LORD ROYCE stands on one side of the room, and dozens of
KNIGHTS OF THE VALE stand by the walls, watching Arya.
Arya glances at the Knights of the Vale on either side of
her. Far more men than she could kill, and all of them loyal
to Sansa.
She sees Littlefinger leaning against the wall, in the same
position where he stood at the end of 610. Watching Arya with
the faintest trace of a smile.
Not a good sign, Arya. She glances behind her as the door is
shut and Knights of the Vale fill the gap. Surrounded on all
sides.
The room is very quiet. Arya looks at her sister.
ARYA
Are you sure you want to do this?
A beat before Sansa replies.
SANSA
It’s not what I want. It’s what
honor demands.
Arya smiles.
ARYA
And what does honor demand?
SANSA
That I defend my family from those
who would harm us. That I defend
the north from those who would
betray us.
Arya nods. She glances at Littlefinger, who stares back at
her. She looks at Lord Royce. No love there. Bran, her baby
brother? Nothing.
ARYA
All right, then. Get on with it.
SANSA
You stand accused of murder. You
stand accused of treason.
Sansa’s eyeline shifts.
SANSA
How do you answer these charges,
Lord Baelish?
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 42.
Littlefinger stiffens, as everyone in the room looks at him.
Everyone else is in on it. For once, Littlefinger is the man
on the outside.
As if caught in a bad dream, he cannot speak for a moment.
ARYA
My sister asked you a question.
LITTLEFINGER
Lady Sansa... forgive me. I’m a bit
confused--
SANSA
Which charges confuse you? Let’s
start with the simplest one. You
murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You
pushed her through the Moon Door
and watched her fall. Do you deny
it?
Littlefinger stares at her, unable to process what’s
happening. He turns and sees Lord Royce staring coldly at
him.
LITTLEFINGER
I did it to protect you--
SANSA
You did it to take power in the
Vale. Earlier you conspired to
murder Jon Arryn. You gave Lysa
Tears of Lys to poison him. Do you
deny it?
Littlefinger opens his mouth but cannot speak for a beat. How
does she know this?
LITTLEFINGER
Whatever your aunt might have told
you... she was a troubled woman. She imagined enemies everywhere.
SANSA
You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to
our parents, telling them it was
the Lannisters who murdered Jon
Arryn. When really it was you.
Littlefinger is one of the coolest cucumbers in the garden,
but even he starts to sweat now. His prosecutor is armed with
information she cannot possibly know.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 43.
SANSA
The conflict between the Starks and
the Lannisters, it was you who
started it. Do you deny it?
LITTLEFINGER
I know of no such letter.
SANSA
You conspired with Cersei Lannister
and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our
father, Ned Stark. Thanks to your
treachery he was imprisoned and
later executed on false charges of
treason. Do you deny it?
The walls are closing in on Littlefinger. But he’s not going
down without a fight.
LITTLEFINGER
I deny it. None of you were there
to see what happened. None of you
knows the truth--
BRAN
You held a knife to his throat. You
said, “I did warn you not to trust
me.”
Littlefinger looks at Bran. And now he understands how all
his crimes have come to light.
Arya draws the Valyrian steel dagger.
ARYA
You told our mother this knife
belonged to Tyrion Lannister. But
that was another one of your lies. It was yours.
Littlefinger sees the steel glint in the torchlight.
He turns back to Sansa.
LITTLEFINGER
Lady Sansa. I’ve known you since
you were a girl. I’ve protected
you--
SANSA
Protected me? By selling me to the
Boltons?
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 44.
LITTLEFINGER
If we could speak alone, I can
explain everything.
SANSA
Sometimes, when I’m trying to
understand a person’s motives, I
play a little game. I assume the
worst. What's the worst reason you
have for turning me against my
sister? But that’s what you do,
isn’t it? That’s what you’ve always
done. Turn family against family,
turn sister against sister. That’s
what you did to our mother and Aunt
Lysa. And that’s what you tried to
do to us.
LITTLEFINGER
Sansa. Please.
SANSA
I’m a slow learner, it’s true. But
I learn.
LITTLEFINGER
Give me a chance to defend myself.
I deserve that.
Seeing no hint of mercy on Sansa’s face he turns to Lord
Royce.
LITTLEFINGER
I am Lord Protector of the Vale and
I command you to escort me safely
back to the Eyrie.
Lord Royce stares at Littlefinger. He would behead the man
himself, but it’s not his place.
LORD ROYCE
I think not.
Littlefinger realizes too late that the best laid plans gang
aft agley, an' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain.
He sinks to his knees.
LITTLEFINGER
Sansa. I beg you. I loved your
mother since the time I was a boy.
CONTINUED: (4)

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 45.
SANSA
And yet you betrayed her.
LITTLEFINGER
I loved you more than anyone.
SANSA
And yet you betrayed me.
Sansa stands.
SANSA
When you brought me back to
Winterfell, you told me there’s no
justice in the world. Not unless we
make it.
She nods to Arya.
Littlefinger glances at the Stark girl, who now walks toward
him, a petite executioner, dagger in hand.
SANSA
Thank you for all your many
lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never
forget them.
LITTLEFINGER
Sansa--
Arya swipes the dagger across his throat so fast he doesn't
see it happening until it's over.
He falls face forward to the floor, clutching at his throat, trying to keep his life blood from spilling out.
Everyone in the great hall watches him die. And no one moves
a muscle to help him.
INT. RED KEEP - MAP ROOM - DAY
Jaime is in the midst of giving orders to LANNISTER GENERALS.
JAIME
Our men in King’s Landing will
march north in three days time.
As Jaime continues to speak, we cut to the second level of
the large room. Cersei, trailed by the Mountain, approaches
the balcony looking over the huge painted map and looks down
at the men below.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 46.
LANNISTER GENERAL
It’ll take us a fortnight just to
gather supplies for the train--
JAIME
We don’t have a fortnight. If the
north falls, we fall. Three days.
Cersei steps away from the balcony and moves for the stairs,
followed by the Mountain.
JAIME
The remaining forces in the
Westerlands will take the River
Road east. We’ll meet at Lord
Harroway’s Town, and march together
to Winterfell.
CERSEI
Ser Jaime.
Jaime glances over to where Cersei now approaches, trailed by
her fearsome bodyguard.
JAIME
Your grace.
CERSEI
My lords. I need a moment with my
brother.
The Generals bow to their queen and depart.
Cersei waits for them to go before turning on Jaime.
The Mountain waits at a respectful distance, always watching
Jaime.
CERSEI
What are you doing?
JAIME
Preparing the expedition north.
CERSEI
The expedition north.
(beat)
I always knew you were the
stupidest Lannister.
Jaime opens his mouth but quickly closes it. Painful
experience has taught him not to interrupt Cersei when she’s
about to begin a rant.
CONTINUED:

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 47.
CERSEI
The Starks and Targaryens have
united against us-- and you want to
fight alongside them? Are you a
traitor or an idiot?
JAIME
You pledged our forces [to fight
our common]--
CERSEI
(speaking over him)
I will say whatever I need to say
to insure the survival of our
House. You expect me to trust the
man who murdered our father? You
expect me to command our troops to
fight beside foreign scum? To fight
for the Dragon Queen?
JAIME
You saw it with your own eyes. You
saw a dead man trying to kill us.
CERSEI
And I saw it burn. If dragons can’t
stop them, if Dothraki and
Unsullied and Northmen can’t stop
them, how will our army make a
difference?
JAIME
This isn’t about noble houses. This
is about the living and the dead--
CERSEI
And I intend to stay amongst the
living! Let the Stark boy and his
new queen defend the north. We stay
here, where we’ve always been.
JAIME
I made a promise--
She approaches him, trying a gentler tack, looking up at his
bewildered face.
CERSEI
Our child will rule Westeros.
JAIME
Our child will never be born, if
the dead come south.

CERSEI
The monsters are real. The White
walkers. The dragons. The Dothraki
screamers-- all the frightening
stories we heard when we were
young, they’re all real. So be it.
Let the monsters kill each other.
While they battle in the north,
we’ll take back the lands that
belong to us.
JAIME
And then what?
CERSEI
And then we rule.
JAIME
When the fight in the north is
over, someone wins. You understand
that, don’t you? If the dead win,
they march south and kill us all.
If the living win and we’ve
betrayed them, they march south and
kill us all.
CERSEI
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all. Most
of them will die in the north.
JAIME
I faced them in the field. We can’t
beat them. We can’t beat their
dragons--
CERSEI
How many dragons did you see at the
pit?
Jaime’s not sure what she’s getting at.
JAIME
Two.
CERSEI
What happened to the third?
JAIME
For all we know it’s guarding her
fleet.

CERSEI
(shaking her head)
She came here with her dragons and
her Dothraki and her Unsullied --
she came to show us all her power.
No, something happened. The dragons
are vulnerable.
Cersei’s intransigence frustrates Jaime. He’s battled these
forces on the field. He knows what they’re up against.
JAIME
We can’t beat the Dothraki. We
don’t have the numbers, we don’t
have the support of the other
houses.
CERSEI
We have something better. We have
the Iron Bank.
Jaime can only stare at her.
CERSEI
You should have listened more when
father spoke about the importance
of gold. Oh, I know it was boring
for you. You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight. But I listened. I learned. (beat)
Highgarden bought us the most
powerful army in Essos. The Golden
Company. 20,000 men, horses... elephants, I believe.
JAIME
The Golden Company is not here. They are in Essos. How is a
mercenary company in Essos going to
help us?
CERSEI
Did you really think Euron Greyjoy
turned tail and sailed back to the
Iron Islands? Do you think he
abandoned the chance to marry the
Queen?
A beat. Jaime really did believe it.

CERSEI
No one walks away from me. He’s
sailing with his fleet to Essos.
He’s going to ferry the Golden
Company back here to help us win
the war for Westeros.
JAIME
You plotted with Euron Greyjoy.
Without telling me. The commander
of your armies.
CERSEI
And you conspired with Tyrion, the
man who murdered our father.
Without telling me. Your queen.
JAIME
I didn’t conspire with him!
CERSEI
You met him in secret, without my
consent. You planned to promote my
enemies’ interests. That is the
definition of conspiracy.
JAIME
I pledged to ride north. I intend
to honor that pledge.
CERSEI
And that would be treason.
JAIME
Treason?!
CERSEI
Disobeying your Queen’s command. Fighting with her enemies. What
would you call it?
Jaime considers his response for a long beat, staring at his
sister, his lover, his queen.
JAIME
It doesn’t matter what I’d call it.
He turns to go but finds that the Mountain stands directly in
his way.

Jaime turns and looks at her again.
JAIME
Are you going to order him to kill

Cersei stares at him.
JAIME
I’m the only one you have left. Our
children are gone. Our father is
gone. It’s just me and you now.
CERSEI
There’s one more yet to come.
Jaime nods.
JAIME
Give the order, then.
He watches her and waits.
The Mountain waits for a command from his queen.
She nods. The smallest possible nod.
The Mountain draws his sword.
Jaime knows there’s no point fighting. He knows he will be
cut in half.
He stares at his sister for a long beat.
JAIME

I don’t believe you.
After a long beat, Jaime turns and walks away, right past the
Mountain and his drawn sword.
Cersei watches. She does not give the command.
EXT. OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING - DAY
Jaime rides north, the city behind him.
He’s no longer wearing his Lannister uniform. He’s no longer
commanding an army, or representing his house. He’s dressed
so as not to stand out, in the manner of Bronn, a sellsword
with no affiliations.

He glances down at his golden hand, a hand that makes him

black leather glove (specially designed for his golden hand).
As he finishes he notices a single snowflake landing on the
black leather.
He looks up at the overcast sky. He glances back at the
capital, and the high towers of the Red Keep.
He trots forward, never looking back again, a lone horseman
heading north on the Kingsroad.
EXT. KING’S LANDING - LOCATIONS - NIGHT
We watch the snow fall in various locations we’ve visited in

An outlandish claim, but Sam believes it.

Why did you come to Winterfell?
SAMWELL
Jon’s the one to lead the fight
against the dead. I know he is. But
he can’t do it alone. So I’ve come
here to help him.
Bran weighs this, and deems it acceptable.
BRAN
He’s on his way back to Winterfell. With Daenerys Targaryen.

father's son. He's the son of
Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt,
Lyanna Stark.
Sam stares at Bran for a long beat. What he’s just heard, if
true, is news that changes everything.
Bran looks away.
BRAN
He was born in a tower in Dorne.
His last name isn’t really Snow.
It’s Sand.
Sam puts everything together.
Holy shit.
SAMWELL
It’s not.
Bran’s not truly capable of surprise anymore, but he’s
confused now.
BRAN
Dornish bastards are named Sand.

High Septon’s diary. (beat)
He annulled Rhaegar’s marriage to
Elia.
This is something Bran didn’t know.

We go extremely close on Bran, his eyes wide open.
When we pull back, we realize we’re no longer in Bran’s room.
We’re in:
EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
Bran watches
RHAEGAR TARGARYEN, silver-haired, tall and handsome. He
stands by LYANNA STARK, both of them nervous but happy.
Lyanna looks up into Rhaegar’s eyes as HIGH SEPTON MAYNARD
binds their hands with the wedding wrap in a ceremony that
should look quite similar to the marriage of Robb Stark and
Talisa.
Their love for each other would be obvious to any bystander.
Bran stands close by, watching them say the words:
RHAEGAR
Father. Smith. Warrior. Mother. Maiden. Crone. Stranger. I am hers, and she
is mine, from this day, until
the end of my days.
LYANNA
Father. Smith. Warrior. Mother. Maiden. Crone. Stranger. I am his, and he is
mine, from this day, until
the end of my days.
BRAN (V.O.)
Robert’s Rebellion was built on a
lie.

Then Dany stands aside and Jon enters the room.
At the far end of the corridor, Tyrion watches from the

He’s never been a bastard.
Their faces are inches apart. Their eyes are wide open.
BRAN (V.O.)
He’s the heir to the Iron Throne.
They kiss.

Tyrion watches Dany’s closed door.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 57.
Looking troubled for more reasons than one, he turns away,
enters his own cabin and shuts the door behind him.
BRAN (V.O.)
He needs to know.
EXT. DANY'S FLAGSHIP - SEA - NIGHT
BRAN (V.O.)
We need to tell him.
Dany's ship makes its way north, toward White Harbor, the
dragon-emblazoned sails fluttering in the moonlight.
EXT. WINTERFELL BATTLEMENTS - DAY
The storm has passed.
Sansa and Arya look out across the snowy landscape. Arya
looks up at her big sister.
ARYA
Are you all right?
Sansa nods.
SANSA
It’s just strange. (beat)
In his own horrible way, I believe
he loved me.
Arya shrugs. She doesn’t have any angst about it.
ARYA
You did the right thing.
SANSA
You did it.
ARYA
I’m just the executioner. You
passed the sentence. You’re the
Lady of Winterfell.
Sansa glances at her.
SANSA
Does that bother you?
Arya shakes her head. Nope.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 58.
ARYA
I was never going to be as good a
lady as you. So I had to be
something else.
(beat)
I never could have survived what
you survived.
SANSA
You would have. You’re the
strongest person I know.
Arya looks at her big sister again.
ARYA
I believe that’s the nicest thing
you’ve ever said to me.
SANSA
Well. Don’t get used to it. You’re
still very strange and annoying.
Arya smiles. She stares north with Sansa.
ARYA
In winter, we must protect
ourselves, look after one another.
Sansa knows those words.
SANSA
Father.
Arya nods. He said it all so many times, they know it by
heart.
SANSA
When the snows fall and the white
winds blow, the lone wolf dies but
the pack survives.
They are silent for a beat.
ARYA
I miss him.
SANSA
Me too.
We crane up and away from the Stark sisters.
CONTINUED:
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 59.
EXT. GODSWOOD - DAY
We crane down from the weirwood's leaves to find Bran sitting
at the base of the tree, his eyes rolled back.
EXT. EASTWATCH, TOP OF THE WALL - DAY
As before, we fly to the Wall with a flock of birds, piloted
by Bran. A bunch of them land on the Wall battlements above
Eastwatch.
TORMUND walks the battlements, gazing north for the enemy he
knows is coming.
He looks down the battlements to BERIC, who is up here with
him, along with a few other WILDLINGS. They’ve all taken well
to the strange role of serving as guardians of the Wall.
BERIC
It’s a long way down.
TORMUND
Eh. Crows keep telling me I’ll get
used to it.
A few NIGHT’S WATCHMEN are up here as well.
Tormund hears a strange sound, getting louder. He looks down
to the north side of the Wall. Beric looks as well.
EXT. EASTWATCH, NORTH SIDE OF THE WALL
Emerging from the frozen coastal forest, the ARMY OF THE DEAD
comes in force. All of them, 100,000 strong, with hundreds of
WHITE WALKER officer corps on their dead horses.
EXT. EASTWATCH, TOP OF THE WALL - DAY
One of the Night’s Watchmen runs to the large horn and blasts
three times.
EXT. EASTWATCH, NORTH SIDE OF THE WALL
The Army of the Dead halts in the no-man’s-land between the
forest and the Wall, the Walkers on their dead horses in
front of the wight foot soldiers.
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 60.
Tormund exhales, looks to Beric. It's true, that whole thing
about them being unable to pass the Wall because of ancient
spells and such. He’ll live another day.
But then a stranger sound comes from the north. Tormund looks
to the sky, and sees a mote on the horizon, coming in fast.
Very fast.
It's moving so fast we don't get a clear look at it or the
NIGHT KING on its back before it is upon us...
EXT. EASTWATCH, NORTH SIDE OF THE WALL
...hitting the Wall with a blast of blue flame.
Bran's meaningful birds take flight.
A massive chunk of the Wall breaks free ahead of Tormund. The
ice dragon glides away, and we get our first clear look at
him, and at the Night King on his back. He's done the same
thing to Viserion that he did to Craster's sons. Only those
were babies, and this is a dragon.
EXT. EASTWATCH, TOP OF THE WALL - DAY
TORMUND
(shouting a command)
Run! Run!
Tormund and Beric lead their wildling comrades to the stairs
carved in the ice -- Eastwatch has a massive zig-zag
stairway, not an elevator like Castle Black.
They run for their lives and disappear from view.
EXT. EASTWATCH, NORTH SIDE OF THE WALL
The Night King and his dragon circle back, coming in for the
kill.
Hovering near the base of the Wall, the ice dragon shoots
forth a steady stream of blue fire, thick as a tree trunk,
strafing back and forth along the base of the Wall.
The Wall cannot withstand the fire. Thunderously, it begins
to give way, sending pieces falling into the sea like a
calving iceberg.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 61.
We see a few Wildling stragglers who didn’t make it down in
time fall hundreds of feet to their death.
The ice dragon keeps blasting until a huge breach has been
opened, one large enough to admit the Army of the Dead, all
100,000 of them. And the White Walkers. And the Night King,
flying low over their heads, into the camera --
-- and away from it. All of them heading south, for the world
of men.

 (PILOT) 
EXT. CLEARING - DAY
Snow drifts across the bodies of the fallen dead. Eight
corpses lie frozen on the ground-- men, women, and children,
wearing heavy furs. The wind whips through their long hair.
At the edge of the clearing, WILL (20), a young ranger
dressed all in black, surveys the grim scene from the back of
his gelding. He gathers his reins and guides his horse south.
EXT. FOREST - DUSK
Will rides hard between the towering pines, his horse’s
hooves kicking up fresh-fallen snow.
He comes to a halt and dismounts beside two tethered horses.
His comrades, GARED (50) and SER WAYMAR ROYCE (18), crouch
beside a stream, filling their skins with cold water. They
rise and look to the newcomer expectantly.
Ser Waymar is gray-eyed and graceful, with an aristocrat’s
air of command despite his youth. He wears a supple coat of
gleaming black ringmail and a lush sable cloak.
Will and Gared also wear the black of the Night’s Watch, but
their clothes are far less regal, their leather and fur
battered from hard usage. Gared wears a hood for warmth.
WILL
We should start back. They’re all
dead.
Gared offers Will his water skin and Will takes a drink.
SER WAYMAR
Any blood?
WILL
Not that I saw.
SER WAYMAR
How close did you get?
WILL
Close enough to see they was dead.
SER WAYMAR
(skeptical)
Or sleeping?
GARED
If Will says they’re dead, they’re
dead. We should head back to the
Wall. 
SER WAYMAR
(with the hint of a smile)
Do the dead frighten you?
GARED
Mormont said we should track ‘em.
We tracked ‘em. They won’t trouble
us no more.
SER WAYMAR
You don’t think Mormont will ask us
how they died?
He walks toward his horse. Gared and Will exchange a troubled
glance.
EXT. EMPTY CAMP - NIGHT
Moonlight shines down on the clearing, the ashes of the
firepit, the snow-covered lean-to. If there were corpses on
the ground before, they’re gone now.
The three riders enter the camp. Their horses seem spooked,
as if they smell a predator nearby.
SER WAYMAR
Your dead men seem to have moved
camp.
Will looks around, confused. He knows what he saw.
WILL
They were here...
Spotting something shimmering on the ground near the firepit,
he walks his horse closer, dismounts and looks down.
Lying at his feet is the hilt of a steel longsword. The blade
has been shattered into a thousand shards.
Will stares at the shattered sword. He knows what this means;
the dread on his face is unmistakable.
From his horse, Gared looks at the ground. The indentations
where the bodies once lay are still visible-- as are the
faint but unmistakable footprints leading away from them.
GARED
We have to move. Now.
He is interrupted by a neigh. Will’s horse, riderless and
panicked, bolts from the camp site.
2.
Ser Waymar’s horse rears back on its hind legs, throwing its
rider to the ground before galloping after the first horse.
Gared struggles to keep his own horse under control. Ser
Waymar stands unsteadily, brushing the snow from his cloak.
WILL
(terrified)
Gods...
He’s staring into the darkness at the edge of the clearing.
Ser Waymar turns to see what the young tracker sees: a shadow
emerging from the forest.
A figure steps into the moonlight, tall and gaunt, with flesh
pale as milk. It slides toward the rangers on silent feet.
Its armor appears to be carved from ice. Its sword is
translucent, a shard of crystal so thin it almost seems to
vanish when seen edge-on.
Ser Waymar’s voice cracks like a boy’s:
SER WAYMAR
Stay where you are!
The OTHER keeps coming. Ser Waymar draws his sword with
trembling hands. Will, standing near the fire pit, and Gared,
still on horseback, draw their own swords.
The Other halts. For the first time we see its eyes, bluer
than any human eyes, a blue that burns like ice.
They emerge silently from the shadows, on all sides of the
clearing. Five of them... six... seven... their strange
swords shimmering in the moonlight.
Gared can no longer control his panicked horse; it bolts from
the clearing, ignoring its rider’s commands.
The Others watch Gared flee. They turn back to Ser Waymar and
Will and begin to advance on the young men.
As the circle closes, the Others speak to each other in a
language we’ve never heard, with voices like cracking ice.
Waymar and Will stand together, class distinctions forgotten,
two boys about to die. They steady their sword hands and
mutter quick prayers as the Others descend upon them.
CREDIT SEQUENCE
3.
CLOSE on a pair of ancient, gnarled hands writing a message
on a small parchment scroll. The old man (we never see his
face) tightly rolls the scroll, binds it with a black ribbon,
and ties it with a leather strip to the leg of a BLACK RAVEN.
The old man lifts the raven off his desk; it flaps its dark
wings and flies out of the open chamber window.
The raven flies away from Castle Black, a large and ancient
fortress dwarfed by what lies behind it: the Wall. Older than
history, this is the 800-foot-high barrier of ice and stone
that guards the northern edge of the Seven Kingdoms.
As the raven gains altitude, the landscape below it
TRANSFORMS into a map of Westeros. The Wall is revealed to
cross the entire continent, a boundary between the Haunted
Forest to the north and the civilized lands to the south.
The raven flies south over the map, on which the cities,
regions and features of the land are named: Winterfell, the
Kingsroad, Moat Cailin, the Riverlands, the Vale of Arryn.
Occasionally the bird dips down, and the map resolves back
into reality for just long enough to give us a view of some
points of interest: Winterfell’s old stone towers, full of
cold beauty. The foreboding Eyrie castle high atop the Vale
of Arryn, a feat of montane architecture that would have been
impossible for medieval engineers.
When the raven reaches King’s Landing, the map resolves back
into reality as the bird drops down into the dirty sprawl of
the capital.
The raven flies through the open gates of the Red Keep, a
massive compound with red walls the color of blood. The bird
flies through an open window into the throne room, to land on
the Iron Throne itself-- a throne built from the hammered
swords of a thousand defeated enemies.
The raven pecks at its wings, cleaning itself after the long
journey, alone in the empty throne room.
END CREDIT SEQUENCE
EXT. HILLTOP - DAY
LORD EDDARD “NED” STARK (40) sits on his motionless horse,
his long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely-trimmed
beard is shot with white. He has spent half his life training
for war and the other half waging it, and his face conveys
both authority and a haunted sadness.
4.
He is accompanied by a dozen members of the HOUSEHOLD GUARD,
all on horseback. Over their heads flaps the Stark banner: a
gray direwolf racing across an ice-white field.
South of the Wall the grass is still green and the sun is
shining, but the air is cold enough to cloud the breath of
four guardsmen as they escort Gared toward the stump of a
massive oak tree.
Weeks have passed since we saw the ranger but he seems to
have aged years, his eyes bloodshot and weary, his face
haggard, his clothes filthy and torn.
Ned’s sons, JON SNOW (17), ROBB STARK (17) and BRAN STARK (8)
sit on their own horses (a small pony in Bran’s case).
Jon is slender, darker than his half-brothers, his eyes black
and watchful.
Robb is big and broad, with fair skin and reddish-brown hair.
Bran sits very still, watching the doomed man. He has never
seen an execution before. The prospect of it terrifies him,
but he tries hard to imitate his father’s solemn expression.
The Guardsmen force Gared’s head onto the stump. Ned
dismounts.
His ward, THEON GREYJOY (19), hands over Ned’s sword: Ice, a
beautiful weapon, centuries old. Theon is the only man in the
party wearing a kraken sigil instead of a dire wolf.
Ned peels off his gloves and hands them to JORY CASSEL (30s),
a bull-necked warrior with a heavy mustache.
Ned walks to the stump. He speaks in low tones to Gared, who
responds. We watch this exchange from the boys’ perspective.
Gared’s final words clearly trouble Ned, who studies the
condemned man’s face, judging his honesty.
Bran watches from afar, his head slightly cocked, trying to
make out what Gared is saying.
There is a great weariness in Ned’s eyes as he places both
hands on the hilt of his greatsword.
NED
In the name of Robert of the House
Baratheon, the First of his Name--
As Ned delivers the formal sentence to the condemned man, Jon
Snow moves closer to Bran.
5.
JON SNOW
(whisper)
Keep the pony in hand. And
don’t look away. Father will
know if you do.
NED (O.S.)
King of the Andals and the
First Men, Lord of the Seven
Kingdoms and Protector of the
Realm--
Bran keeps his pony well in hand and does not look away.
NED
I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord
of Winterfell and Warden of the
North, sentence you to die.
Ned lifts Ice high above his head and brings it down.
Blood sprays the swaying grass.
Gared’s head topples off the stump, bounces off a root, and
rolls. When Ned’s back is turned, Theon put his boot on the
head, kicks it away and laughs.
Jon watches this with disgust but says nothing. He turns and
grips Bran’s shoulder.
JON SNOW
You did well.
It’s only three words, but compliments are hard to come by in
the Stark house. Bran is proud to be treated like a man, but
he cannot look away from the head lying in the tall grass.
EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
Bran rides with his brothers, his hard-working pony trying to
keep up with the bigger horses.
JON SNOW
I thought he was brave.
ROBB
Brave? He was dead of fear. You
could see it in his eyes.
JON SNOW
What would be in your eyes with
your head on the stump? He died
well. Give him that much.
Robb considers the point for a moment and shrugs, already
losing interest in the subject.
ROBB
Race you to the bridge?
6.
Jon rolls his eyes as if he’s beyond such juvenile games--
then, without warning, he spurs his horse and gains a good
head start. Robb curses and follows. They gallop off down the
trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent.
Bran’s pony can’t compete in that race, so he follows slowly
behind, craning his neck to see if he can spot the winner.
NED
You understand why I did it?
Bran turns in his saddle, startled. On his great warhorse,
Ned looms above him like a giant. Bran nods to his father.
BRAN
Jon said he was a deserter. He was
in the Night’s Watch and he ran
away.
Even when speaking with his son, Ned constantly surveys his
surroundings, aware of his men’s positions, the possible
sites for an ambush, the angle of the sun.
NED
True enough, but do you understand
why I had to kill him?
Bran thinks about this for a few seconds, confused.
BRAN
King Robert has a headsman.
NED
He does. As did the Targaryen kings
before him.
Ned reaches out to grab the pommel on Bran’s saddle. He
forces the horse and pony to walk very close.
NED
Our way is the old way. The man who
passes the sentence should swing
the sword.
Bran stares at the massive sword sheathed at Ned’s hip.
BRAN
Is it true he saw the Others?
Ned stares at his son for a long beat.
7.
NED
You heard that?
(off Bran’s nod)
The Others have been gone for eight
thousand years.
BRAN
So he was lying?
NED
He believed it. A madman sees what
he sees.
They’re interrupted by the sound of hooves; Jon reappears on
the crest of the hill before them, waving urgently.
JON
Over here!
EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY
Ned’s party reaches the riverbank. Jon has dismounted beside
Robb, who cradles something in his arm.
Bran and Ned stay back with the rest of their party as Jory
and Theon approach the older boys.
When he sees what lies on the ground beside Robb, Theon
curses and pulls his horse away. Jory does the same and yells
to the boys:
JORY
Get away from it!
ROBB
She can’t hurt you. She’s dead.
Burning with curiosity, Bran spurs his pony to keep up with
Ned as they approach the others, who are all dismounting.
THEON
What in hell is it?
Bran finally gets close enough to see.
ROBB
A wolf.
The dead wolf is impossibly huge, bigger than Bran’s pony.
Its blind eyes crawl with maggots.
THEON
It’s a freak.
8.
JON
No. That’s a direwolf.
Ned kneels beside the wolf. Groping under the beast’s head,
he gives a yank and comes up with a foot of shattered antler,
slick with half-dried blood.
THEON
There hasn’t been a direwolf south
of the Wall for two hundred years.
Jon looks at the bundle beneath Robb’s arm and grins:
JON
Well... now there are five.
When Bran sees what everyone is staring at his eyes widen. He
moves in to get a closer look at the direwolf pup-- a tiny
ball of gray-black fur, eyes still closed, nuzzling blindly
against Robb’s chest, whimpering.
JORY
Tough old beast, wasn’t she?
Birthing a litter with an antler in
her throat.
ROBB
(to Bran)
Go on. You can touch him.
Bran gives the pup a quick, nervous stroke. As he turns:
JON
Here you go.
Jon thrusts another pup into Bran’s arms. Overjoyed, Bran
plops down in the snow and rubs the wolf pup’s soft fur
against his cheek.
Ned picks up two more helpless pups, one in each hand. Jon
picks up the fifth.
HULLEN (40s), the horse master, frowns at this ill omen.
HULLEN
Direwolves loose in the realm.
THEON
Not for long.
Theon draws his sword and reaches for Bran’s pup.
9.
THEON
Give it here.
BRAN
No! It’s mine!
Robb speaks to Theon in a commanding tone.
ROBB
Put your sword away. We’re keeping
them.
Theon bristles at the command.
THEON
I take orders from your father, not
you.
HULLEN
It’ll be a mercy to kill them.
BRAN
No!
Bran looks to Ned for support, but finds none.
NED
Better a quick death. They won’t
last without their mother.
JON
Lord Stark... There are five pups.
Three male, two female.
(off Ned’s curiosity)
You have five trueborn children.
Three sons, two daughters. The
direwolf is the sigil of your
House.
Everyone looks to the Stark banners, with their direwolf
crest-of-arms. We see their opinions about the pups change,
as they come to understand the import of this omen.
JON
Your children were meant to have
these pups.
NED
And you?
JON
I am not a Stark, my Lord.
10.
Ned weighs the situation for a moment in silence.
NED
You will feed them yourselves. And
train them yourselves.
Bran nods eagerly. Robb nods as well.
NED
They may die anyway, despite all
you do.
ROBB
They won’t. We won’t let them.
The decision made, people start to remount their horses.
Bran tugs gratefully on Jon’s sleeve. Jon smiles at him, but
beneath his smile there is a trace of sadness.
Jon is about to climb onto his horse when he hears a distant
whimpering. Leaving the horse behind, he ranges into a snow
drift, and scans the ground until he finds the source:
A sixth wolf pup, with white fur. Unlike the others, its eyes
are blood-red and open, and it is completely silent. Jon
picks it up.
Theon scoffs.
THEON
An albino. It’ll die even faster
than the others.
Jon ignores Theon. He stares into the pup’s eyes and the pup
stares back.
JON
This one belongs to me.
INT. DRESSING ROOM - SUNSET
DAENERYS (15) stands by the window, staring out at the bay of
Pentos, where shirtless FISHERMEN haul nets full of wriggling
fish from their boats onto the docks. The setting sun
silhouettes the brick towers of the Free City; intricate and
colorful geometric patterns decorate their bulbous domes.
Daenerys is a beautiful girl but nobody has bothered to tell
her. She is awkward in her own skin, unaware of how rare her
violet eyes and lush silver hair really are.
11.
VISERYS (O.S.)
Where’s my sweet sister?
VISERYS (20) steps into the room, a gaunt young man with
nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale eyes. He holds
a lilac gown in his hands.
VISERYS
A gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Go
on. Feel the fabric.
Dany lets the delicate silk run through her fingers. It is a
gorgeous gown but the sight of it gives her no pleasure.
VISERYS
Tonight you must look like a
princess.
Daenerys hands the gown back to her brother.
DAENERYS
He gives us so much... we’ve been
his guests for a year and he’s
never asked for anything.
VISERYS
Illyrio’s no fool. He knows I won’t
forget my friends when I come into
my throne.
He hangs the gown from a hook beside the door.
VISERYS
I’ll send the slaves in to bathe
you. Be sure you wash off that
stable stink.
He studies her critically.
VISERYS
You still slouch.
He pushes back her shoulders.
VISERYS
Let them see you have a woman’s
body now.
His fingers brush lightly over her breasts, judging their
shape beneath the rough fabric of her tunic.
12.
VISERYS
Don’t fail me tonight. You don’t
want to wake the dragon, do you?
His fingers tighten over one of her nipples, pinching. He’s
hurting her but Daenerys does not resist or open her mouth.
VISERYS
Do you?
DAENERYS
No.
VISERYS
Good.
He smiles, releasing her, brushing back her hair with
something like affection.
VISERYS
When they write the history of my
reign, they will say it began
tonight.
EXT. STREETS OF PENTOS - NIGHT
A dozen STRONG MEN carry a palanquin through the pitch-black
streets of Pentos. Two SERVANTS walk in front, holding oil
lanterns to light the way.
INT. PALANQUIN - NIGHT
Inside the curtained litter, Daenerys, Viserys and MAGISTER
ILLYRIO recline on soft pillows. Daenerys wears the lilac
gown. Her makeup has been artfully applied but somehow she
looks even younger than before. She seems terribly nervous.
Illyrio (50) is tremendously fat, but he carries himself with
a certain elegance. He smiles at Daenerys, takes the girl’s
hand and gives her a comforting squeeze.
ILLYRIO
(to Viserys)
She is a vision, your Grace. Drogo
will be impressed.
VISERYS
She’s too skinny. Are you sure he
likes his women this young?
ILLYRIO
She’s had her blood, she’s old
enough. Look at her!
13.
(MORE)
Highest of the highborn, daughter
of the past king, sister to the
future king... he’ll want her.
VISERYS
I suppose. The savages have queer
tastes. Boys, horses, sheep...
ILLYRIO
Best not suggest this to Khal
Drogo.
VISERYS
Do you take me for a fool?
Magister Illyrio gives a slight bow.
ILLYRIO
I take you for a king. Kings lack
the caution of common men. My
apologies if I have given offense.
He claps his hands and a SLAVE BOY wearing a brass collar,
crouched in the corner of the litter, hurries over to refill
Illyrio’s wine glass.
VISERYS
I know how to play a man like
Drogo. I give him status--
(nodding at Dany)
-- and he gives me an army.
His fingers toy with the hilt of his sheathed sword.
VISERYS
I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms
with ten thousand Dothraki
screamers behind me. The people
will be with us. They cry out for
their true king.
Viserys pauses and gives Illyrio an anxious look.
VISERYS
They do, don’t they?
ILLYRIO
(an amiable salesman)
All across the Kingdoms, men lift
secret toasts to your health. Their
women sew dragon banners in hope of
your return from across the water.
(shrugs)
Or so my agents tell me.
14.
ILLYRIO (cont'd)
Daenerys, who has watched Illyrio throughout his speech,
turns away. She keeps her own counsel, but it’s clear the
words that so inspire Viserys do not impress her.
EXT. DOTHRAKI ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
A great field outside the city walls of Pentos, ringed by
hundreds of the distinctive, round Dothraki tents.
The moon and burning torches light the milling guests. Many
are DOTHRAKI HORSELORDS, big men, their black hair oiled and
braided and hung with silver bells. No women are present.
A smooth-cheeked EUNUCH announces the newcomers:
EUNUCH
Viserys of the House Targaryen, the
Third of his Name. King of the
Andals and the First Men, Lord of
the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of
the Realm. His sister Daenerys
Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone.
His honorable host, Illyrio
Mopatis, Magister of the Free City
of Pentos.
The three honored guests step into the clearing. Illyrio
guides them, pointing out various luminaries.
ILLYRIO
Those three are Drogo’s
bloodriders.
The BLOODRIDERS, fearsome Dothraki warriors, stare back at
Daenerys. She quickly averts her eyes.
ILLYRIO
Over there is Ser Jorah Mormont.
VISERYS
A knight? What’s he doing here?
SER JORAH is past forty and balding, but still strong and
fit. When he sees the Targaryens staring at him he bows
deeply. Viserys gives a slight nod, pleased by the obeisance.
ILLYRIO
King Robert-
(correcting himself)
-the Usurper wanted his head. Some
trifling affront. Sold poachers to
a slaver.
15.
VISERYS
He could be useful.
Illyrio places his hand on Daenerys’ bare shoulder.
ILLYRIO
Over there, sweet princess. There
is the Khal himself.
KHAL DROGO (30) is the tallest man in the courtyard, but
despite his size and musculature, he has the grace of a
panther. His black hair is woven into a single braid, hung
with silver bells, that swings below his belt.
Illyrio walks over to the Khal (a dozen yards away). Viserys
leans closer to his sister, never taking his eyes off Drogo.
VISERYS
You see how long his hair is? When
Dothraki are defeated in combat,
they cut off their braids in
disgrace, so the world will know
their shame. Khal Drogo has never
been defeated. A savage, of course,
but one of the finest killers
alive. And you will be his queen.
Daenerys stares at the Khal. The man’s face is hard and
cruel, his eyes dark as onyx as he watches Illyrio perform
his submissions.
DAENERYS
(her voice small and thin)
I don’t want to be his queen.
Please, please, I don’t want to, I
want to go home.
Viserys maintains a mask of politeness and keeps his voice
low, but there is fury behind his eyes.
VISERYS
Home? How do we go home? They took
it from us.
He grabs her arm and drags her into the shadows, his
fingernails digging into her.
VISERYS
How do we go home?
Tears well in her eyes.
16.
DAENERYS
I don’t know.
VISERYS
I do. We go home with an army. With
Khal Drogo’s army.
He brushes her cheek with the back of his hand and speaks to
her with real tenderness.
VISERYS
I’d let his whole khalasar fuck
you, all forty thousand men and
their horses too, if that’s what it
took. Come, dry your eyes.
Dany wipes away the unfallen tears. Illyrio, all smiles and
bows, escorts Khal Drogo toward them.
VISERYS
(nervous whisper)
Smile. And stand up straight. Let
him see that you have breasts. Gods
know, they’re small enough as is.
Dany smiles and stands up straight.
EXT. KING’S LANDING - DAY
The walled city of King’s Landing, capital of Westeros. The
royal castle, the Red Keep, built of red sandstone, perches
on the cliffs above Blackwater Bay. The seven-towered Great
Sept of Baelor rises on the south edge of the city. In
between sprawls the fetid slum called Flea Bottom.
We PULL IN closer to the Red Keep, to a window near the top
of the Tower of the Hand.
INT. BEDCHAMBER - DAY
JON ARRYN (60s), cold and still, lies on his deathbed.
Two SILENT SISTERS, veiled adherents to the Faith of the
Seven, fold his hands across his chest and close his eyelids.
GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE (70s) stands beside them. He wears a
heavy chain around his neck, each link forged with a
different metal.
Beside him is QUEEN CERSEI (30s). Green-eyed and goldenhaired, the queen’s beauty has already become legend. Both
look down at Jon Arryn.
17.
PYCELLE
I gave him milk of the poppy at the
end. To ease his path.
Cersei touches the old Maester’s arm in thanks.
CERSEI
We are blessed to have a man of
your wisdom caring for us.
The old Maester is not too old to appreciate a little
flattery, or the touch of a beautiful woman.
CERSEI
He was peaceful, in his final
hours?
PYCELLE
Mostly he slept, my Grace. Though
he had moments of clarity.
CERSEI
Did he? What did he say, in these
moments of clarity?
PYCELLE
He asked to see the King--
CERSEI
Robert will never forgive himself
for not being here. These hunts of
his last longer and longer.
PYCELLE
And he asked to see Lord Stark.
CERSEI
A shame Lord Stark is a thousand
leagues away. That was all?
PYCELLE
Yes... No. There was a phrase, one
phrase he kept repeating. “The seed
is strong.”
Cersei focuses her green eyes on the Maester.
CERSEI
The seed is strong? What does that
mean?
18.
PYCELLE
(shrugs)
The dying mind is a demented mind.
For all the weight they’re given,
last words usually have as much
significance as first words.
CERSEI
Where is the Hand’s wife?
PYCELLE
Lady Arryn left the moment he
breathed his last.
Cersei turns and heads for the door.
CERSEI
Send a raven to Casterly Rock. My
father should know Jon Arryn is
dead.
PYCELLE
At once, my Grace.
Cersei exits the bedchamber. Pycelle watches the Sisters
perform their ritual ablutions, imagining, perhaps, the nottoo-distant day when they will minister to his own corpse.
EXT. FLEA BOTTOM - NIGHT
The most dangerous neighborhood in the kingdom. DRUNKS spill
out of doorways of taverns lit with oil lamps, singing:
DRUNKS
She kicked and wailed, the maid so
fair, but he licked the honey from
her hair, her hair! Her hair!
INT. BROTHEL - NIGHT
Outside we hear the sounds of rough laughter and singing. The
room is expensively appointed in silks, damasks and gilded
ornaments, but its garishness betrays its true nature.
That, and the naked REDHEADED WHORE on her knees beside the
bed. She bestows oral favors upon TYRION LANNISTER, a dwarf
with mismatched eyes: one green, one black.
Tyrion’s hands grip her hair as he shudders. Bells begin to
ring outside, thousands of them, great pealing bells from all
across the city.
19.
The Redhead, finished with her work, wipes her mouth with the
back of her hand.
REDHEAD
Who they ringing the bells for?
TYRION
The King’s Hand died this morning.
Tyrion grabs a goblet of wine from the bedside table. He
swigs and passes it to the whore. She raises it in toast.
REDHEAD
Here’s to Jon Arryn, then. He was
the only one of you lot who cared
about the smallfolk.
She drinks deeply, sloshing the wine around her mouth.
TYRION
I care about the smallfolk.
REDHEAD
Only the ones with good tits. Who’s
Robert picking for a new Hand?
TYRION
If he’s smart, my father.
REDHEAD
And if he’s not smart?
TYRION
If the King is not smart? Milady,
these are treasonous words...
He clamps his palms on the back of her head and guides her
back toward his crotch.
The Redhead laughs, disbelieving.
REDHEAD
No chance you’re ready again.
He takes the goblet from her, downs the remainder, and tosses
it across the room.
TYRION
The gods gave me one blessing.
The Redhead grins and pushes her hair away from her face as
she dips down for further service.
20.
Just as Tyrion closes his eyes the door swings open. SER
JAIME LANNISTER (30s), the Queen’s twin brother, stands in
the doorway.
Considered by many the best-looking man in the Seven
Kingdoms, there is a hint of savagery behind his green eyes.
He smiles as the Redhead, flustered, covers her breasts.
JAIME
Don’t get up.
REDHEAD
Forgive me, my lord...
TYRION
Should I explain to you, dear
brother, the meaning of a closed
door in a whorehouse?
Jaime continues to favor the redhead with his lazy grin,
fucking her with his eyes as he speaks with his brother.
JAIME
You have much to teach me, no
doubt, but in this instance perhaps
you’ll forgive the interruption.
You told me once that you wanted to
see the North. I didn’t want you to
miss your chance.
TYRION
Who’s going North?
JAIME
We are. The royal “we.” The King.
The Queen. Me. You, if you can find
your pants.
TYRION
Why?
JAIME
Well, I’m used to it, but the rest
of the court might be frightened by
the sight of your wet little
dagger.
TYRION
(annoyed)
Why are we going north?
21.
JAIME
The King has chosen his Hand. And
no one’s going to be happy about
it.
EXT. WINTERFELL GATES - LATE AFTERNOON
Winterfell, the stronghold and ancestral home of House Stark,
is an ancient and austere place. Many acres lie within its
two concentric granite walls; its keeps and towers stretch
toward the gray skies above.
A RAVEN flies into view, heading toward the stronghold with a
small parchment scroll dangling from its leg.
We follow the black bird as it glides over the Winterfell
walls, banks over the main courtyard, and comes to rest on
the windowsill of
INT. MAESTER LUWIN’S CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
The raven jumps from its windowsill perch onto the arm of
MAESTER LUWIN (75). He is a small, gray man: gray eyes, gray
hair, gray wool robe. A heavy chain lies around his neck,
much like Maester Pycelle’s.
The Maester removes the scroll from the raven’s leg and opens
it. His face darkens as he reads.
EXT. GODSWOOD - DUSK
A thousand years of humus lie thick upon the forest floor,
swallowing the sound of a woman’s feet as she walks.
LADY CATELYN STARK (35), Ned’s auburn-haired, blue-eyed wife,
makes her way among the dark tree trunks, their twisted
branches weaving a dense canopy over her head. In her hand,
she holds the small parchment scroll from the above scene.
She reaches a small grove at the center of the wood, where an
ancient weirwood tree broods over a small, black pool.
Looking like no tree on Earth, the weirwood’s bark is bone
white, its leaves dark red. Long, long ago, a melancholy face
was carved into its trunk; its deep-cut eyes are red with
dried sap. They seem to follow her as she rounds the tree.
Seated on a moss-covered stone on the other side of the tree,
Ned rests his sword, Ice, across his knees as he cleans it
with a cloth dipped in the black waters at his feet.
CATELYN
I knew I’d find you here.
22.
He lifts his head to look at her. He sees her shivering and
hands her his cloak, which she wraps around herself before
sitting on the forest floor.
He registers her somber face, and the scroll in her hand. He
stops cleaning his sword.
NED
Tell me.
CATELYN
Forgive me, my lord... there was a
raven from King’s Landing. Jon
Arryn is dead.
Ned looks at the wet sword, lying flat across his lap.
NED
How?
CATELYN
A fever took him. He was healthy at
the full moon and gone by the half.
NED
Your sister, the boy...?
CATELYN
The letter said they’re well.
Ned looks more angry than grief-stricken. He dries his sword
with a swatch of oiled leather.
CATELYN
He loved you very much.
NED
I haven’t seen him in how long,
nine years?
CATELYN
You couldn’t have known--
NED
Of course I could have known. He
was an old man. Every year he asked
me to visit and every year I told
him, “Next year.”
He sheathes the blade. Catelyn reaches for his hand. For a
moment they are silent.
23.
NED
The girls won’t remember him. Bran
never even met him.
CATELYN
You’ll tell them the stories.
NED
Old Jon would have been proud of
Bran. He was a brave boy at the
beheading.
Catelyn is troubled by the thought. She releases his hand.
CATELYN
Eight is too young to see such
things.
NED
Should I tell you about the things
I saw before I was eight?
(beat)
He won’t be a child forever. And
winter is coming.
The words disturb Catelyn but she keeps her silence.
NED
His brothers helped him. Especially
Jon.
CATELYN
Jon Snow is his half-brother. My
lord.
Ned notes his wife’s tone but says nothing. This isn’t a
fight he needs right now. Catelyn, realizing she has broached
the wrong topic at the wrong time, changes the subject.
CATELYN
The raven brought more news. The
king rides for Winterfell.
(beat)
Along with the queen and her
brothers.
Ned considers this prospect for a moment. Clearly Catelyn
already has. They both know what it means.
NED
He hates the cold. Always has. If
he comes this far north, it’s one
thing he’s after.
24.
CATELYN
You can always say No.
Ned allows a grim smile, taking his wife’s hand and helping
her to her feet.
NED
You don’t know the king very well.
EXT. WINTERFELL GATES - DAY
From the stronghold’s gates, the King’s Road wends its way to
the horizon -- where tiny specks of red and gold appear,
barely visible. Very slowly, they grow larger.
The king’s party approaches.
EXT. TOWER - DAY
Bran climbs down the side of the tower, his hands and feet
finding purchase on its jutting stones with a monkey’s
unthinking agility.
Climbing is as natural to him as studying is onerous. He
smiles as he makes his way toward the ground in record time,
very pleased with himself--
Until his mother yanks him off the stones. Catelyn lowers him
to the ground and sternly waits for an explanation.
BRAN
I was... I was...
CATELYN
You were bored with your lesson so
you decided to climb the castle
walls, even though I’ve forbidden
it two hundred times.
BRAN
I--
CATELYN
Brandon... I want you to promise
me: No more climbing. Promise.
Bran looks at his feet before gazing up at her solemnly.
BRAN
I promise.
Catelyn leans over to look her son dead in the eye.
25.
CATELYN
You know what?
BRAN
What?
CATELYN
You always look at your feet before
you lie.
Despite Bran’s best efforts, his mouth stretches into a
smile, and a chuffing laugh escapes from behind it.
Catelyn smiles, unable to help herself. She sees that his
hands, clothes and bare feet are filthy from the climb down.
CATELYN
Go on, clean yourself up. The king
will be here soon.
Bran kisses his mother on the cheek and runs off.
EXT. WINTERFELL GATES - DAY
The king’s party pours through the gates of Winterfell in a
river of gold, silver and steel, one hundred strong.
Over their heads, a dozen golden banners whip in the wind,
emblazoned with the crowned stag of the House Baratheon.
INT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD - DAY
At the far end of the yard, Ned’s face betrays nothing as he
watches the King’s party approach with his family beside him.
Catelyn, Robb, Jon and Bran are here, as are SANSA (13),
traditionally beautiful, with high cheekbones and thick red
hair; ARYA (11), a skinny tomboy; and their little brother
RICKON (3).
Ser Jaime rides through the gate and into the courtyard.
BRAN
(whispering to Jon)
Is that the king?
JON
That’s Jaime Lannister. The
Kingslayer.
Bran can’t take his eyes off the man. He’s heard the stories.
26.
Tyrion Lannister rides behind his brother Jaime, studying the
castle and its occupants, missing nothing.
JOFFREY BARATHEON (13), the crown prince, tall for his age,
and haughty. Beside him:
SANDOR CLEGANE (35), “The Hound,” Joffrey’s bodyguard.
Terrible burn scars cover half his face.
A huge man approaches, flanked by knights in snow-white
cloaks. A black beard covers his double chin, but nothing can
hide the belly that threatens to burst his doublet’s buttons.
This is KING ROBERT BARATHEON (40s). He vaults from his
warhorse and gives Ned an imperious once-over.
ROBERT
You’ve gotten fat.
Ned tries to maintain his stony decorum, but it’s hopeless.
For the first time, we see him laugh -- and it becomes clear
that Ned and the King are actually old friends.
Robert joins in, engulfing him in a bone-crunching hug. He
finally releases Ned, who takes a moment to catch his breath.
ROBERT
Nine years! Why haven’t I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?
NED
Guarding the north for you, your
Grace. Winterfell is yours.
As the king’s party dismounts, an ornate wheelhouse pulls
into their midst. QUEEN CERSEI LANNISTER (32) emerges with
her younger children, TOMMEN (7) and MYRCELLA (8).
Ned kneels to kiss her ring; her smile is pure formality.
Robert, on the other hand, embraces Catelyn like a long lost
sister. As the children on both sides are brought forward and
introduced, Robert steps back to Ned.
ROBERT
Take me down to your crypt. I want
to pay my respects.
CERSEI
We’ve been riding since dawn.
Surely, the dead will wait.
27.
Robert gives her a hard look. Cersei stares back at him,
uncowed. Finally Robert turns and walks away. After an
awkward glance at the Queen, Ned leads Robert toward one of
Winterfell’s old towers.
INT. WINTERFELL - CRYPT STAIRS - DAY
Ned holds a lantern as he leads Robert down the narrow,
winding stone steps.
ROBERT
I thought we’d never get here. All
the talk about my Seven Kingdoms...
a man forgets your part is as big
as the other six combined.
(disbelief)
It snowed on us! Snow!
As they descend, their breath becomes more and more visible
from the cold, and Robert’s becomes more and more labored.
ROBERT
How will you stand it, man, when
winter finally comes? Your balls
frozen right up into your guts for
the next twenty, thirty years?
NED
The Starks will endure. We always
have.
ROBERT
You need to come south, get a real
taste of summer before it’s gone.
Everyone is fat, drunk and rich.
And the girls, Ned! Women lose all
modesty in the heat. They swim
naked in the river, right beneath
the castle...
The king laughs happily, but his laughter trails off as the
staircase ends.
INT. WINTERFELL - CRYPT - CONTINUOUS
Ned sweeps the lantern in a semicircle; shadows lurch along a
procession of granite pillars that recede into the dark.
NED
She’s down at the end, your Grace.
Side by side they proceed, their footsteps ringing off the
stones as they walk among the dead of House Stark.
28.
Between the pillars on either side: granite sculptures of the
deceased sitting on thrones, their backs against their own
sepulchres. Great stone direwolves curl around their feet.
Ned stops at the last tomb and lifts the lantern. The crypt
continues on into the darkness ahead of them, but beyond this
point the tombs are empty, waiting for him and his children.
In front of him, illuminated by the lantern, a beautiful
young woman stares out at them with blind, granite eyes:
Lyanna Stark, Ned’s sister.
ROBERT
She was more beautiful than that.
Silently, Robert kneels and bows his head. Ned joins him.
Robert’s voice is hoarse with remembered grief.
ROBERT
Did you have to bury her in a place
like this? She should be on a hill
somewhere, with the sun and the
clouds above her.
NED
She was a Stark. This is her place.
The king rises to touch her cheek, his fingers brushing the
rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh.
ROBERT
In my dreams, I kill him every
night.
NED
It’s done. The Targaryens are gone.
The warrior Robert used to be surfaces in his face, pitiless.
ROBERT
Not all of them.
NED
We should return, your Grace. Your
wife will be waiting.
ROBERT
To hell with my wife.
That said, he starts back the way they came. Ned follows.
29.
ROBERT
And if I hear “your Grace” one more
time, I’ll have your fucking head
on a spike. We’re more to each
other than that.
NED
I haven’t forgotten.
(beat)
Tell me about old Jon.
ROBERT
(shakes his head)
One moment he was fine, and... It
burned right through him, whatever
it was.
(stops walking)
I loved that man.
NED
We both did.
ROBERT
He never had to teach you much. But
me? You remember me at sixteen? All
I wanted to do was crack skulls and
fuck girls. Old Jon showed me what
was what.
Ned gives the king a sidelong, skeptical look, barely
suppressing a smile.
ROBERT
Don’t look at me like that. It’s
not his fault I didn’t listen.
He puts a massive arm around Ned’s shoulder and walks on.
ROBERT
You must wonder why I’ve finally
come north, after all these years.
NED
Your inspection of the Wall is long
overdue.
ROBERT
The Wall’s stood for eight thousand
years. It can keep a while longer.
Robert stops walking and turns to face Ned.
30.
ROBERT
These are dangerous times... I need
good men around me, men like Jon
Arryn.
(beat)
Men like you. I want you down in
King’s Landing, not up here where
you’re no damn use to anybody.
(stops walking)
Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you
Hand of the King.
Ned drops to one knee, not at all surprised.
NED
I’m not worthy of the honor.
ROBERT
I’m not trying to honor you. I’m
trying to get you to run my kingdom
while I eat, drink and whore my way
to an early grave. You know the
saying...
NED
The King shits, and the Hand wipes.
Robert laughs. Still on one knee, Ned can’t help but join him.
ROBERT
Damn it, Ned, stand up.
(Ned does)
You helped me win the Iron Throne,
now help me keep the fucking thing.
We were meant to rule together.
(beat)
If your sister had lived, we’d have
been bound by blood. Well, it’s not
too late. I have a son, you have a
daughter... my Joff and your Sansa
will join our houses.
This does surprise Ned. After a moment he shakes his head and
smiles.
NED
How long have you been planning
this?
ROBERT
How old is your daughter?
Both men laugh. Robert’s face grows serious.
31.
ROBERT
I never loved my brothers. A sad
thing for a man to admit, but it’s
true. You were the brother I chose.
We were meant to be family.
NED
(moved by these words)
I don’t know what to say.
ROBERT
Say “Yes”!
NED
If I could have some time to
consider these honors...
ROBERT
Yes, of course, talk it over with
Catelyn, sleep on it if you must.
He claps his hands roughly on Ned’s shoulders.
ROBERT
Just don’t keep me waiting too
long. I’m not the most patient man.
Ned smiles-- but his glance drifts over Robert’s shoulder to
the dead of Winterfell, who watch with disapproving eyes.
INT. GREAT HALL OF WINTERFELL - NIGHT
The feast for the king is in its fourth hour. A SINGER plays
the harp at one end of the hall but no one can hear him above
the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups,
and the din of a hundred conversations.
The long wooden tables are covered with steaming platters of
roasted meats and baked breads.
Banners hang from the stone walls: the dire wolf of Stark;
Baratheon’s crowned stag; the lion of Lannister.
Ned and Catelyn host King Robert (already drunk), Queen
Cersei, Ser Jaime and Tyrion Lannister (the queen’s brothers)
and a few other luminaries at a table on a raised platform.
The Stark and Baratheon trueborn children sit at a table
directly below the guests of honor.
On the main floor, the SOLDIERS, SQUIRES and other COMMONERS
sit on backless benches. Jon Snow sits with them.
32.
The young men sitting around Jon are telling the usual
stories about fighting and fucking. Jon seems comfortable in
their midst, but he’s not paying attention to them; he’s
stealing a glance at his siblings, at their table of honor.
Jon downs his wine, and signals a serving boy for a refill,
and watches his father and the King and the high table.
Robert and Ned toast with tankards full of ale. Ned takes a
healthy drink; Robert drinks the whole tankard.
A few seats down, Catelyn notices Queen Cersei staring at her
drunk husband with plain disgust. A good hostess, Catelyn
tries to distract Cersei.
CATELYN
Your children are quite beautiful,
my Queen. They have the gift of the
Lannister eyes.
Cersei, a little startled to be addressed, stares at Catelyn
with her vaguely reptilian green eyes.
CERSEI
I heard a rumor we might share a
grandchild someday.
CATELYN
(pleased)
I heard the same rumor...
CERSEI
Of course, these decisions
ultimately fall to our husbands. As
all important decisions must.
She glances past Catelyn to Robert, as he gnaws on a rib and
leers at the BUXOM SERVING GIRL refilling his tankard. Only
her eyes reveal her anger, and they only do so briefly.
Jaime, sitting on the other side of Cersei, leans forward,
his forearms on the table, flashing his white teeth at
Catelyn. Many women have waited their whole lives for that
smile, but it only serves to make her nervous.
JAIME
You’d enjoy the capital, my lady.
The north must be hard for someone
who wasn’t born here.
CATELYN
I’m sure it seems very grim, after
King’s Landing.
33.
(MORE)
I remember how scared I was when
Ned brought me up here the first
time.
CERSEI
You were only a girl. I’m sure you
were scared of many things.
CATELYN
But harsh as it is, I’ve come to
love it. The north gets in your
blood.
Cersei seems skeptical, looking around the rough-hewn Great
Hall, which would fit in the kitchen of her own palace.
CERSEI
Your daughter will take to the
city. Such a beauty can’t stay
hidden up here forever. It’s time
we introduce her to the court.
CATELYN
Mm... of course, I have two
daughters.
If Cersei knew this at one point, she had forgotten. She sees
Catelyn’s distressed look and follows her gaze to the
children’s table, where Sansa looks as radiant as ever,
chatting with young Princess Myrcella.
Arya, on the other hand, has already ruined her evening
dress. She uses her spoon as a catapult to fling a wad of
pigeon pie at Bran, across the table. It hits him square in
the forehead.
JAIME
The girl has talent.
Catelyn, embarrassed, begins to stand so she can take matters
in hand. But Ned, passing behind her, grips her shoulders,
leans down and kisses the side of her neck.
NED
I’ll take care of it.
Cersei smiles at Catelyn. To her credit, she has an excellent
fake smile. The two women resume their conversation.
As Ned passes behind Jaime’s seat, Jaime pushes his chair
back, momentarily blocking Ned’s path. Jaime stands.
JAIME
Excuse my clumsiness.
34.
CATELYN (cont'd)
He smiles down at Ned. Jaime is taller and broader in the
shoulders. They are considered two of the greatest warriors
in the Seven Kingdoms, and there can be little doubt that
right now each man wonders who would win a fight.
NED
Not a trait most people associate
with you. Your pardon--
He moves to step around Jaime, but Jaime puts his hand on
Ned’s shoulder.
JAIME
I hear we might be neighbors soon.
I hope it’s true.
Ned would rather talk to any living man than this one.
NED
Yes, the King has honored me with
his offer.
Again he tries to pass, and again Jaime sidesteps to block
him. Jaime smiles but his actions are just shy of aggression.
JAIME
The King has promised a tournament
to celebrate your new title... if
you accept. It would be good to
have you on the field. The
competition has become a bit stale.
NED
I don’t fight in tournaments.
JAIME
No? Getting a little old for it?
Ned is tired of trying to get around Jaime. He stands very
close to the younger man and looks him dead in the eye.
NED
I don’t fight in tournaments
because if I ever have to fight a
man for real, I don’t want him to
know what I can do.
The comment pleases Jaime immensely, judging from his smile.
JAIME
Well said, well said! I do hope you
take the King’s offer.
35.
(MORE)
Though of course, we all know the
court hasn’t been kind to Stark
men.
Ned stiffens at the comment. Nobody wears swords at the
banquet but his hand reflexively grips for the absent hilt.
JAIME
Your father and brother. Yes, I was
a witness to that... tragedy.
NED
I know you were.
JAIME
I suppose it’s some consolation
that justice finally came to their
killer. No need to thank me-- oh,
I’m sorry, you never did.
NED
Was it justice you were thinking of
when you shoved your spear in the
Mad King’s back?
JAIME
It was his kidneys I was thinking
of. His liver and spleen. Was that
terrible of me? After all the
suffering the man caused?
Ned has had enough. He pushes past Jaime. This time the
Kingslayer lets him go, but not before one final remark. For
an instant Jaime’s air of perpetual amusement evaporates.
JAIME
The worst king in a thousand
years... and people treat me like
some back-alley cutthroat.
But Ned is already gone, heading down the raised platform.
Jaime stands alone. The only one at the banquet table who has
overheard the Jaime/Ned conversation is Tyrion, who grins at
his brother and raises his tankard in toast.
TYRION
If it came down to it, big brother,
I’d bet on you-- but I wouldn’t bet
much.
He downs his tankard of ale with a single, heroic gulp and
wipes the foam from his mouth, pleased with himself.
36.
JAIME (cont'd)
A second later it hits him: he’s one tankard over the line.
Tyrion stands and staggers away from the royal table without
a goodbye.
Jaime retakes his seat beside his sister, who watches Tyrion
stumble down the steps to the main floor.
CERSEI
He is a vile little beast.
JAIME
He plays the hand he was dealt.
His gaze floats over Cersei’s shoulder, to Robert.
JAIME
As do we all.
Tyrion lurches past Ned on the main floor, nearly bumping
into him. Ned extends a hand to steady the little man but
Tyrion brushes past him, not wanting any help, heading for
the exit.
Ned turns; for a second, from where Jon Snow is sitting, it
seems Ned is staring right at him.
Jon smiles at his father, eager for acknowledgement. A wink
would suffice.
But Ned wasn’t looking at him at all; his eyes are on the
table of trueborn children that lies between Jon and Ned. Ned
heads over to break up the Arya/Bran foodfight.
Slightly bitter, more than slightly drunk, Jon takes a large
hunk of honeyed chicken from his trencher and chucks it under
the table to his dire wolf puppy, GHOST. The way Ghost
devours it in seconds is cute -- until we remember the size
of his mother.
One of the boys at the table is filling wine cups from a
flagon. Jon nods for another cup and gulps from it while
watching his pup lick the chicken bones clean.
JON SNOW
You never stop eating, do you?
BENJEN (O.S.)
Is this one of the direwolves I’ve
heard so much about?
Jon looks up happily as his uncle BENJEN STARK (40s) ruffles
his hair.
37.
Benjen is sharp-featured and gaunt, but there’s always a hint
of laughter in his eyes. He wears the black garb of a sworn
brother of the Night’s Watch.
JON
His name is Ghost.
One of the squires at the table makes room. Benjen straddles
the bench, takes the cup from Jon’s hand and sips.
BENJEN
How many cups have you had?
(off Jon’s guilty smile)
As I feared. Well, I believe I was
younger than you the first time I
got truly and sincerely drunk.
Benjen grabs a roasted onion from a nearby trencher and bites
into it. He watches Ghost as he chews.
BENJEN
Don’t you usually eat with your
brothers?
JON
(flat, sardonic)
Most times. But Lady Stark thought
it might insult the royal family to
seat a bastard among them.
BENJEN
I see.
Benjen glances over his shoulder at the elevated table, where
Ned returns to sit with Catelyn.
BENJEN
My brother doesn’t seem so festive
tonight.
JON
He’s sad about Jon Arryn.
Jon’s eyes go to the queen.
JON
The queen is angry. Father took the
king down to the crypts this
afternoon. She didn’t want him to
go.
Benjen gives Jon a careful, measuring look.
38.
BENJEN
You don’t miss much, do you?
(beat)
We could use a man like you on the
Wall, someday.
JON
(a sudden rush)
Take me with you when you go back.
Father will let me go if you ask
him. I know he will.
BENJEN
The Wall is a hard place for a boy.
JON
I turn seventeen on my next name
day. And Maester Luwin says
bastards grow up faster.
BENJEN
(frowning)
That’s true enough.
Benjen fills the wine cup and takes a long swallow.
JON
I want to serve in the Night’s
Watch. I’m ready to swear your
oath.
BENJEN
You don’t understand what you’d be
giving up. We have no families.
None of us will ever father sons.
JON
I don’t care about that!
BENJEN
You might, if you knew what it
meant. Come talk to me after you’ve
dipped your wick a few times.
He stands, grips his nephew’s shoulder, and takes his leave.
Frustrated, Jon drains his cup, slams it on the table and
rises from the bench. Too late he realizes how drunk he
really is-- he lurches into a SERVING GIRL, sending a flagon
of wine crashing to the floor.
Laughter booms all around. Jon flushes and runs for the door.
Ghost follows at his heels.
39.
EXT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD - NIGHT
The yard is quiet and empty. High on the battlements of the
inner wall, a lone SENTRY takes brief notice of Jon as he
storms from the banquet hall with Ghost close behind.
The music and song spilling through the hall’s open windows
seem to taunt Jon as he walks away from the feast.
TYRION (O.S.)
Boy.
Jon turns to see Tyrion Lannister sitting like a gargoyle on
the ledge above the door to the great hall. Tyrion is drunk
like Jon, only more so.
TYRION
Is that animal a wolf?
JON
A direwolf. His name is Ghost.
(beat)
What are you doing up there? Why
aren’t you at the feast?
TYRION
I learned long ago that it’s
considered rude to vomit on one’s
brother. Might I have a closer look
at your wolf?
Jon hesitates, nods-- and gasps as Tyrion pushes himself off
the ledge, falls twelve feet to the ground and lands roughly.
Ghost flinches and backs away behind Jon’s legs.
Tyrion stands and dusts himself off.
TYRION
I’ve frightened the beast. My
apologies.
JON
He’s not afraid.
TYRION
He is! I am terrifying!
He is not. Jon commands his wolf:
JON
Ghost, come here. Come on, boy...
40.
The pup comes back around front, keeping a wary eye on
Tyrion. When Tyrion reaches out to pet him, Ghost bares his
fangs in a silent snarl. Tyrion hesitates.
JON
Sit, Ghost.
(Ghost sits; to Ghost)
Hold.
(to Tyrion)
You can touch him now. He won’t
move. I’ve been training him.
Tyrion kneels and ruffles the white fur between Ghost’s ears.
TYRION
Nice wolf. Niiiiice wolf.
JON
He’s not. If I wasn’t here, he’d
have your throat out.
Tyrion cocks his head and looks Jon over, possibly impressed
by the boy’s bravado. Ghost is still far too small to tear
out anyone’s throat.
TYRION
In that case, you’d best stay
close.
He stands and looks up at Jon.
TYRION
I am Tyrion Lannister.
JON
I know who you are.
TYRION
You’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t
you?
Jon presses his lips together and says nothing.
TYRION
Did I offend you? Sorry.
(beat)
You are the bastard, though.
JON
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
Tyrion steps in closer and examines Jon’s face.
41.
TYRION
Yes... you have more of the north
in you than your brothers.
Jon tries to hide his pleasure at this observation.
JON
Half brothers.
Tyrion’s mouth is fixed in a sardonic grin, but his eyes burn
with intensity as he speaks.
TYRION
Let me give you some advice,
bastard. Never forget what you are--
the rest of the world will not.
Make it your strength, and it can
never be your weakness. Wear it
like armor, and it can never be
used to hurt you.
Jon is in no mood for anyone’s advice.
JON
What do you know about being a
bastard?
TYRION
All dwarfs are bastards in their
father’s eyes.
Tyrion saunters back into the feast, whistling to himself.
When he opens the door, the light from the hall throws
Tyrion’s shadow clear across the yard.
INT. CATELYN’S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT
Ned opens the room’s high narrow windows.
A blast of cold night air blows into the chamber. On the bed,
Catelyn pulls the furs up to her chin. Ned breathes deeply,
taking the cold into his lungs, staring out into the dark.
Then he turns back to face her.
NED
I’ll refuse him.
CATELYN
You cannot. You must not.
NED
You said yourself I could tell him
no. I’m a northman.
42.
(MORE)
I belong here, not down south in
that rats’ nest they call a
capital.
CATELYN
He would make our daughter Queen.
Ned turns away, facing the darkness again. She softens and is
about to go to him when a loud knock comes at the door.
NED
I gave orders not to be disturbed.
From the other side of the door, a SENTRY answers.
SENTRY (O.S.)
It’s Maester Luwin calling, my
lord. He insists.
Ned slips on a heavy robe.
NED
Send him in.
The door opens and Maester Luwin enters. He waits until the
door is shut behind him before speaking.
MAESTER LUWIN
My lord, pardon for disturbing your
rest. I have been left a message.
NED
Been left? By whom?
MAESTER LUWIN
There was no messenger, my lord.
Only a carved wooden box, left on a
table in my observatory while I
slept. This was concealed in a
false bottom.
Maester Luwin draws a tightly rolled paper from his loose
sleeves. Ned holds out his hand.
NED
Let me have it, then.
MAESTER LUWIN
A thousand pardons, my lord. The
message is marked for the eyes of
the Lady Catelyn alone.
Ned isn’t used to being denied by anyone below the rank of
king.
43.
NED (cont'd)
He considers the old man for a second and steps aside,
allowing Maester Luwin to place the paper on the bedside
table. Luwin bows and begins to retreat.
NED
Stay.
Catelyn looks at the blue wax moon-and-falcon seal on the
paper with foreboding.
CATELYN
It’s from my sister. Something’s
wrong. Why would she hide the
letter? They said she left the
capital right after he died...
NED
Open it.
Catelyn breaks the seal. Her eyes move over the words. For a
moment, she is confused-- then a smile flits across her lips.
CATELYN
She took no chances. When we were
girls, we had a private language.
NED
Can you still read it?
CATELYN
Yes...
Her smile disappears as she reads.
Catelyn wraps herself in one of the bed furs and pads toward
the hearth. She tosses the paper in the fire and watches to
make sure it burns through.
CATELYN
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.
(beat)
By the Lannisters. By the Queen.
The accusation shocks Ned. He tries to rationalize it away:
NED
Your sister is sick with grief. She
doesn’t know what she’s saying.
CATELYN
Lysa isn’t easy, but she’s never
been a fool.
44.
NED
This is madness...
CATELYN
You say you love Robert like a
brother. Would you leave your
brother surrounded by Lannisters?
Ned looks to Maester Luwin, hoping for a different opinion.
MAESTER LUWIN
The Hand of the King has great
power, my lord. Power to
investigate. And to punish, if need
be.
CATELYN
You must go south with him. Become
his Hand and learn the truth.
NED
I am not your dog to command, my
lady.
But Ned’s words are belied by the resignation in his face.
She is right and he knows it. He sits heavily in a chair
beside the hearth.
NED
My father went south once, to
answer the summons of a king. He
never came home again.
MAESTER LUWIN
A different time. A different king.
Ned says nothing, watching the flames devour the wood.
INT. WINTERFELL - TOWER ROOM - DAY
Sansa and Princess Myrcella both knit, overseen by Myrcella’s
ladies-in-waiting, and Sansa’s tutor, SEPTA MORDANE (60s).
Arya sits near the door. Her needlework is as grim as Sansa’s
is perfect, her face as plain as Sansa’s is beautiful.
She doesn’t want to be here. While the Septa fawns over the
princess, Arya quietly lays down her knitting and sneaks away.
45.
EXT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD - DAY
Bran and Prince Tommen drill in the yard with padded wooden
swords. The children are so heavily padded themselves that
they look like they’ve been wrapped in featherbeds.
Huffing and puffing, they thump each other under the watchful
eye of SER RODRIK CASSEL (60), the master-at-arms, a stout
keg of a man with thick white sideburns.
A dozen (male) spectators call out encouragements, Robb the
loudest among them. Theon Greyjoy watches with his
characteristic wry contempt.
Twenty yards from the others, Jon Snow watches as well,
seated alone on a rough wooden bench. Absorbed in the action,
he is unaware of Arya’s approach until she jumps on his back.
JON
Shouldn’t you be working on your
stitches?
Arya makes a face at him.
ARYA
I wanted to see them fight. Why
aren’t you with them?
JON
Bastards aren’t allowed to damage
young princes.
Arya watches her little brother Bran whack at Tommen, almost
toppling over himself in the process.
ARYA
I could do better than Bran. I’d
knock the prince’s fat head off.
Jon looks at her with mock shock. Then he takes her arm and
examines it, feeling her muscle. He shakes his head.
JON
Too skinny.
She snatches back her arm and glares at him. He messes up her
hair. A cheer goes up from the drilling field.
Bran has managed to knock Tommen over; the prince is rolling
in the dust, trying to get up and failing, like a padded
turtle. Bran stands at the ready with upraised wooden sword,
ready to whack him again once he regains his feet.
46.
The spectators laugh until Ser Rodrik ends it. He yanks the
prince to his feet.
SER RODRIK
Well fought. Prince Joffrey, Robb,
will you go another round?
ROBB
Gladly.
Joffrey, however, looks bored; he remains among his men.
JOFFREY
This is a child’s game.
THEON
That’s because you’re children.
JOFFREY
Robb may be a child. I am a prince.
And I’m tired of swatting at Starks
with a play sword.
ROBB
You got more swats than you gave.
Afraid?
JOFFREY
Oh, terrified. I might get a
splinter.
The Lannister men all laugh.
Jon and Arya watch with contempt.
JON
What a shit.
Ser Rodrik asks Joffrey:
SER RODRIK
What do you suggest?
JOFFREY
Live steel.
ROBB
Done.
Ser Rodrik puts a hand on Robb’s shoulder.
47.
SER RODRIK
Too dangerous. I’ll let you go with
tourney swords with blunted edges.
A muscled knight with black hair and terrible burn scars on
his face pushes forward: Sandor “The Hound” Clegane,
Joffrey’s bodyguard.
THE HOUND
This is your prince. Who are you to
tell him he can’t have an edge on
his sword?
(to Robb)
How old are you, boy?
ROBB
Sixteen.
THE HOUND
I killed a man at twelve. And not
with a blunt sword.
Arya watches with worry as Robb bristles, his pride wounded.
ROBB
(to Ser Rodrik)
Let me do it. I can beat him.
SER RODRIK
Beat him with a tourney blade,
then.
Joffrey shrugs and starts to turn away.
JOFFREY
Come and see me, north boy, once
your balls thaw.
Laughter from the Lannister men. Robb loses his temper.
ROBB
I’ll cut yours off, you little pisshairedArya’s and Jon’s eyes widen in surprise.
But Theon seizes Robb’s arm to keep him away from the prince.
Joffrey feigns a yawn and turns to his younger brother.
JOFFREY
Come, Tommen. Playtime is over.
Leave the children to their games.
48.
More laughter from the Lannisters, more curses from Robb.
Theon continues to hold Robb back, now aided by Ser Rodrik,
until the Lannister party is safely away.
Far from being frightened, Arya is thrilled. This is where
she wants to be, among the rough and brawling boys.
JON
(to Arya)
You’d better get back.
ARYA
I hate needlework! It’s not fair!
JON
Nothing is fair.
He messes her hair again and walks away, Ghost following
silently. Reluctantly, Arya turns in the other direction.
In the distance, she sees Septa Mordane waiting for her
– along with Lady Catelyn herself. Neither looks pleased.
Arya sighs and goes to take what she’s got coming.
EXT. DOTHRAKI ENCAMPMENT - DAY
Outside the city walls of Pentos, hordes of DOTHRAKI
WARRIORS–- along with their WOMEN, CHILDREN, and SLAVES–-
have gathered to celebrate their Khal’s wedding day.
An earthen ramp has been raised in the middle of a vast grass
field. Dany sits beside Khal Drogo. Beautiful as she is in
her wedding silks, she looks as scared as a trapped animal.
Khal Drogo does not seem to notice her. He shouts commands
and jests in his own tongue to his bloodriders, who sit below
him on the second-highest level of the ramp.
Also seated on that level are Jorah Mormont, Magister
Illyrio, and Viserys, who looks splendid in a new black wool
tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest. They are in the
midst of an urgent conversation, keeping their voices low.
Illyrio waves languidly, rings glittering on his fingers.
ILLYRIO
Trust me. The Khal has promised you
a crown and you shall have it.
VISERYS
When?
49.
ILLYRIO
When the Khal chooses. When the
omens favor war.
VISERYS
I piss on Dothraki omens. I’ve
waited fifteen years to get my
throne back. I’m tired of this
country, tired of living with
savages.
Above them on the ramp, Daenerys steals a glance at Khal
Drogo. He seems unaware of her existence, staring at the
grass below with no expression on his face.
Daenerys turns to see what he’s watching: Dothraki drummers
pound on their horseskin drums as a dozen young Dothraki
women begin dancing for their Khal.
The Dothraki are not a repressed people. The dance is overtly
sexual, so overt that a warrior soon steps into the circle,
grabs a dancer by the arm, pushes her to the ground and takes
her right there in front of the cheering crowd.
Khal Drogo grins and nods. Evidently this is appropriate
wedding behavior. Daenerys watches with horror.
Soon a second warrior has grabbed a dancer, and then a third.
The trouble begins when two warriors try to lay claim to the
same woman. Both men draw their scimitars and begin swinging
at each other.
The combat is fast, brutal and efficient, the steel blades
blurring in the sunlight. Finally one man misses a parry. An
instant later his entrails spill onto the dust and he falls.
The victor seizes a girl-- not even the original girl they
were fighting over-- and the crowd roars in approval.
Daenerys struggles to keep from vomiting. The platter of
blood sausages in front of her do not help.
Illyrio claps politely and explains to Viserys:
ILLYRIO
A Dothraki wedding without at least
three deaths is considered a dull
affair.
Khal Drogo stands and raises one hand. Instantly the horde
goes silent. The only noise is the bleating of a lost sheep.
50.
Drogo looks at Dany. There is no sign of mercy in his face.
She realizes that everyone at the wedding is watching her.
Finally she stands. He nods and leads her down the ramp, into
the center of the field.
Dany stands beside her new husband, encircled by her new
tribe, looking very small and pale next to Drogo.
ILLYRIO
(to Viserys)
Time for the gifts.
Dothraki men surge forward, prostrating themselves before
their Khal and laying down gifts in a growing pile: medallion
belts and painted vests, soft furs and silks, silver rings.
Viserys approaches with a thin smile on his face. He leads
three HANDMAIDS. Two are Dothraki girls with black hair and
almond-shaped eyes. The third is fair-haired and blue-eyed.
VISERYS
(to Dany)
These are not common servants. Irri
will teach you riding, Jaqui the
Dothraki tongue, and Doreah... the
art of love.
He grins at Doreah, who lowers her eyes.
VISERYS
She’s quite good. Illyrio and I can
vouch for that.
Ser Jorah approaches next, laying a small stack of old books
before Dany and bowing deeply.
JORAH
A small gift, my princess, but all a
poor exile could afford. Songs and
histories of the Seven Kingdoms.
The gift touches Dany: she smiles, and speaks for the first
time at her own wedding.
DAENARYS
Thank you, Ser.
Ser Jorah is pleased that his gift is pleasing. He glances at
Khal Drogo, bows again, and steps back.
Illyrio snaps his fingers. Four BURLY SLAVES hurry forward,
bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze.
51.
Illyrio bows low and gestures for Dany to open the chest.
Inside, resting on a pile of fine velvets and damasks, are
three large eggs: one green, one cream, one black.
She takes one into her hands. The egg shimmers like polished
metal. The surface of the shell is covered with tiny scales.
ILLYRIO
Dragon’s eggs, from the Shadow
Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have
turned them to stone, but they will
always be beautiful.
Viserys, standing beside Ser Jorah, rolls his eyes.
VISERYS
Fakes, of course.
Fake or real, the egg mesmerizes Dany. She rolls it in her
hands, letting the light play off the shell.
DAENARYS
Thank you, Magister. I owe you
everything.
Khal Drogo walks into the crowd. The Dothraki part for him.
Daenerys, confused, tries to hide her anxiety. The Dothraki
look back at her. To her, they are an exotic people, but to
them she is like a visitor from another planet. They have
never seen a girl with silver hair and violet eyes before.
Drogo reemerges from the crowd, leading a splendid young
filly, gray as the winter sea.
Everyone waits to see how Dany will react. Hesitantly she
reaches out to stroke the horse’s neck, running her fingers
through its mane.
Drogo says something in the Dothraki tongue and Illyrio
translates.
ILLYRIO
Silver for the silver of your hair,
the Khal says.
DAENERYS
(murmuring)
She’s beautiful.
Drogo steps forward, puts his hands on Dany’s waist, lifts
her as easily as if she were a child’s doll, and places her
on the filly’s thin saddle.
52.
The Dothraki stare at their new queen.
DAENERYS
(to Illyrio)
What should I do?
Ser Jorah answers for the Magister.
JORAH
Take the reins and ride. You don’t
have to go far.
Dany gathers the reins and slips her feet into the stirrups.
She squeezes gently with her knees and the filly breaks into
a trot. At first Dany seems frightened, but as the crowd
parts for her and the speed increases, she smiles.
She sends the filly into a gallop through the campground, and
now the Dothraki are hooting and laughing and shouting at
her, impressed by their new khaleesi’s spirit.
At full speed Dany and the filly circle back, a little out of
control. A fire pit looms ahead, directly in their path. They
are hemmed in on either side by hollering Dothraki. There is
no way out but straight ahead.
The silver horse leaps the flames as if she had wings.
The crowd cheers. Dany pulls up beside Illyrio.
DAENERYS
Tell Khal Drogo he has given me the
wind.
Illyrio translates the line. And for the first time that
we’ve seen, Khal Drogo smiles.
The bloodriders bring forth the Khal’s horse, a lean red
stallion, and Drogo mounts.
Viserys approaches Daenerys on her filly. He looks very
pleasant as he grips his sister’s leg.
VISERYS
Make him happy.
His fingers dig into her thigh and Daenerys flinches.
Khal Drogo trots off on his stallion and Dany follows behind,
looking back at Viserys and Illyrio and Ser Jorah.
The exhilaration that brightened her face a minute before is
gone. The fear is back.
53.
EXT. MEADOW - DUSK
Drogo drives his stallion at a hard trot, the tiny silver
bells in his long braid ringing softly as he rides.
Dany follows behind. The sun is down and the darkening sky
above her head is vast and ominous.
They ride through a meadow of cattails and tall grass.
EXT. STREAM - DUSK
Drogo stops at a grassy spot beside a gently-flowing stream.
He swings off his horse and lifts Dany off hers.
She stands there, helpless and trembling in her wedding
silks, while Drogo secures the horses to a nearby tree.
When he returns Dany starts to cry. Drogo stares at her, his
face strangely empty of expression. He rubs away her tears
with a callused thumb.
KHAL DROGO
No.
DAENERYS
You know the Common Tongue?
KHAL DROGO
No.
He touches her hair lightly, sliding the silver strands
between his fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki.
Dany does not understand the words, but there is a warmth in
his tone, a tenderness she had not expected.
He puts his finger under her chin and lifts her head, so she
is looking him in the eyes. Drogo towers over her the way he
towers over everyone.
Taking her lightly under the arms he lifts her and seats her
on a rounded rock beside the stream. He sits on the ground
facing her, legs crossed beneath him. Finally their faces are
at the same height.
KHAL DROGO
No.
DAENERYS
Is that the only word you know?
54.
He doesn’t reply. His long heavy braid is coiled in the dirt
beside him. He begins to remove the rings and bells. After a
moment, Dany leans forward to help.
When they are done, Drogo nods. Dany hesitates and then
understands: she begins to undo his braid. He sits silently,
watching her. When she is done he shakes his head and the
hair spreads out behind him like a river of darkness.
Now it’s his turn. Drogo undresses her, his fingers deft and
strangely gentle. He removes her silks one by one while Dany
sits unmoving, staring at his dark eyes.
When he bares her small breasts, she averts her eyes and
covers herself with her hands.
KHAL DROGO
No.
He pulls her hands away from her breasts, gentle but firm. He
lifts her face again to make her look at him.
KHAL DROGO
No.
He pulls off the last of her silks. She shivers in the
evening wind. Khal Drogo, still sitting with his legs
crossed, looks at her, drinking in her body with his eyes.
He runs his hand gently down her leg. He strokes her face,
tracing the curves of her ears, running a finger over her
lips. He turns her around, kissing her from the nape of her
neck to the small of her back.
He pulls her down into his lap. Dany is flushed and
breathless. He cups her face in his huge hands and she looks
into his eyes.
KHAL DROGO
No?
She takes his hand and moves it between her thighs.
DAENERYS
Yes.
EXT. WINTERFELL - COURTYARD - DAWN
Near the main gate, the King’s hunting party is almost ready
to leave. Hullen the horse master checks the saddles; other
retainers sharpen spears and ready the hounds.
55.
Jory, Theon, Ser Rodrik, Benjen and Tyrion outfit themselves.
Tyrion does so very, very slowly; badly hung-over, he looks
like day-old death as he turns to Benjen:
TYRION
If I get through this without
squirting from one end or the
other, it’ll be a miracle.
A few yards deeper into the courtyard, Ned sits on a bench,
strapping a leather-and-steel vambrace to his forearm. He
seems preoccupied and careworn as King Robert steps up behind
him and gives him a friendly shake of the shoulders.
ROBERT
You as good with a spear as you
used to be?
Ned smiles, hiding his worries from the happy king.
NED
No. But I’m still better than you.
Robert laughs. As one of the king’s squires kneels beside
Robert and begins lacing padded half-greaves onto the king’s
legs, Robert squeezes Ned’s shoulder.
ROBERT
I know how much you love it up
here. Coming south with me, serving
as my Hand-- I know it’s not what
you wanted. You’re a loyal friend.
You hear me? A loyal friend. The
last one I’ve got.
Ned stands. The two men clasp hands.
NED
I hope I’ll serve you well.
ROBERT
You will. And I’ll make sure you
don’t look so fucking grim all the
time.
Ned smiles and looks to the hunting party.
NED
I hear the southern boars are twice
as nasty as the ones up here.
56.
ROBERT
Oh, you won’t have time for
hunting. You’ll be too busy
wrangling the snakes that call
themselves my court.
The king laughs, throws his heavy arm across Ned’s shoulders,
and leads him towards the horses.
At the other end of the courtyard, Bran watches the hunting
party mount their horses. He wants very badly to go with
them, but he’s too young.
About fifty yards to his right, he sees Jon Snow sullenly
watching the hunting party as well. Jon has been left behind
himself, for different reasons.
Bran tries to wave to him, but Jon sulks off without seeing
him. Bran sighs, his mood sinking further.
But he hears a small growling at his feet. He looks down to
see his wolf pup-- as yet unnamed-- jerking his head back and
forth, with Bran’s pant leg clamped between his jaws.
Finally, Bran smiles.
BRAN
Come on, you.
He runs off. His wolf bounds after him.
EXT. WINTERFELL - FIRST KEEP - MORNING
With his wolf at his heels, Bran runs toward the First Keep,
the oldest part of the castle.
He reaches the squat round tower and looks up. The Keep has
been deserted for years; its crown has begun to crumble, and
moss grows between the stones. High above, it is festooned
with gargoyles leaning blindly over empty space.
Bran turns to the pup.
BRAN
Lie down. Now stay.
The wolf does as he is told. Bran scratches him behind the
ears, then finds a handhold in the keep wall and begins to
climb, moving from stone to stone quickly and instinctively.
When Bran is about ten feet up, his wolf rises to his feet
and begins to howl. Bran looks down.
57.
His wolf falls silent. There’s something eerily imploring
about the way the animal looks up at him through slitted
yellow eyes. He doesn’t want Bran to keep climbing.
Bran starts climbing again. His wolf starts howling again.
Bran shouts down sternly:
BRAN
Quiet! Sit! Stay!
The wolf continues to howl, until Bran is far, far above him.
Then he drops back down onto his stomach and whines.
Bran scrambles up the rough-cut stones of the ancient tower.
He climbs with no fear and no hesitation. When he gets high
enough he begins swinging from gargoyle to gargoyle. He knows
where to find every handhold and foothold.
He is near the top when a woman’s voice from inside the tower
startles him, nearly causing him to lose his grip.
WOMAN’S VOICE
I don’t like it. You should be the
Hand.
MAN’S VOICE
There’s an honor I can do without.
Far too much work involved.
Clinging to a gargoyle, Bran looks down, past his dangling
feet. The voices come from a row of glassless windows below.
WOMAN’S VOICE
Don’t you see how dangerous this
is? Robert loves the man like a
brother. We’ll have to watch him...
MAN’S VOICE
(lazy; seductive)
I’d rather watch you. Come back
here.
Bran reaches for the next gargoyle over. It seems too far, he
won’t make it...
But Bran has climbed this tower a hundred times. He swings
over to the second gargoyle, straddles the stone monster’s
back, tightens his legs and turns himself upside down.
Perched like a bat, Bran is able to look in through the
window. From his vantage he cannot see the couple’s faces.
58.
A fur cloak has been laid on the stone floor of the unlit
chamber. A naked woman lies belly down on the fur. A naked
man lies on his side beside her, mostly hidden by the
shadows. Their voices echo strangely off the ancient stones.
WOMAN’S VOICE
Stark has never cared about the
south. Never. He wants to move
against us. Why else would he leave
this place? He’s like a king
himself up here.
MAN’S VOICE
Maybe he just wants to be warm for
once in his life.
The naked man grabs her by the hair and forces her to rise to
all fours. She gasps with pain.
WOMAN’S VOICE
Stop...
He does not stop. Keeping one hand on her hair, he pushes
himself to his knees. He seizes her hip with his free hand
and pulls her toward him, thrusting deep into her.
WOMAN’S VOICE
(moaning)
Stop it... stop it... please...
Her voice is low and she does not push him away; the harder
he pulls her hair, the more she moans.
Bran has no idea what to make of all this. He tries to get a
better view and in doing so his sleeve brushes against the
stone edge of the empty window.
The woman turns and stares right at Bran.
Queen Cersei screams.
Everything happens at once. Cersei pushes the man away,
shouting and pointing.
Bran tries to pull himself up, bending double as he reaches
for the gargoyle’s head. In his panic his hands scrape
uselessly against smooth stone, his legs slip, and suddenly
he is falling.
He shoots out a hand and grabs the window ledge. His momentum
forces him to swing against the wall, hard, knocking the wind
out of him. He dangles one-handed, panting.
59.
Faces appear in the window above him: Cersei and her twin
brother, Jaime.
CERSEI
He saw us.
As distraught as the queen looks, Jaime simply seems amused,
watching the terrified boy with a small smile.
Bran’s fingers start to slip. He grabs the ledge with his
other hand. Fingernails dig into unyielding stone. Jaime
reaches down.
JAIME
Take my hand.
Bran seizes Jaime’s arm and holds on with all his strength.
Jaime yanks him up to the ledge with no apparent effort and
stands him on the window sill.
CERSEI
What are you doing?
JAIME
(ignoring her)
How old are you, boy?
BRAN
Eight.
Now that he’s safe, Bran trembles, realizing how close he
came to dying. He releases Jaime’s arm.
Jaime looks at his sister. There is loathing in his voice:
JAIME
The things I do for love.
He shoves Bran. The boy falls backward out the window,
screaming, the courtyard rushing up to meet him.
Somewhere in the distance, a wolf howls.
Crows circle the broken tower.
